PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
Microsoft is a technology company committed to making digital technology and artificial intelligence (“AI”) available broadly and doing so responsibly. Our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. 
We develop and support a broad portfolio of technology solutions for individuals and businesses, focusing on secure, trusted, and innovative platforms and tools that meet evolving customer needs across cloud computing, productivity and collaboration, and personal computing. We strive to create opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world.
AI is fundamentally transforming productivity for every individual, organization, and industry. Microsoft's AI offerings span every layer of the technology stack, enabling transformative outcomes across sectors and unlocking opportunity for every country, community, and individual. 
We believe AI should be as empowering as it is powerful, and we’re committed to designing and deploying AI responsibly with safety and security from the outset.
What We Offer
Founded in 1975, we develop and support software, services, devices, and solutions that deliver new value for customers and help people and businesses realize their full potential.
We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content, and we provide solution support and consulting services. We also deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience.
Our products include operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, and video games. We also design and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.
Digital transformation and adoption of AI continues to revolutionize more business workstreams for organizations in every sector across the globe. For enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations, engages customers, and in some cases, changes the very core of products and services. 
The Microsoft Cloud provides integration across the technology stack while offering openness, improving time to value, reducing costs, and increasing agility. Our cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs. 
We prioritize security above all else and we offer our customers integrated AI-driven products addressing security, compliance, identity, management, and privacy across customers’ multi-cloud, application, and device assets.
The Ambitions That Drive Us
To achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:
Reinvent productivity and business processes to help organizations and individuals work and collaborate more securely and efficiently.
Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform to provide a foundation for our customers’ digital workloads including hybrid consistency, developer productivity, data and AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance.
Create more personal computing to enable users to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways.
Our Future Opportunity	
We are focused on helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their digital spend while leading the AI platform wave across our solution areas. We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our customers that empower people to be productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:
Transforming the workplace to deliver new, modern, modular business applications, drive deeper insights, and improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, and interact with one another.
Building and running cloud-based services in ways that utilize ubiquitous computing to unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.
Applying AI and ambient intelligence to drive insights, revolutionize many types of work and business processes, and provide substantive productivity gains using Microsoft 365 Copilot and agents.
Providing training on generative AI and greater access to digital learning and resources through skilling programs and initiatives, grants, and LinkedIn learning pathways.
Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any device and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming.
Leveraging Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and drive increased engagement with our services like Microsoft Edge, Bing, Copilot, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Consumer, Xbox Game Pass, and more.
Tackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, and management, across all clouds and platforms.
Our future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales motions. 
Commitment to Sustainability
Microsoft is committed to sustainability and our approach to addressing climate change starts with the sustainability of our own business. In 2020, we announced goals to become a carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste company by 2030. Since announcing these goals, we have made meaningful progress while having seen major changes in both the technology sector and in our understanding of what it will take to meet our goals. Progress toward these goals can be found in our annual Environmental Sustainability Report.
OPERATING SEGMENTS
We operate our business and report our financial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses.
In August 2024, we announced changes to the composition of our segments. These changes align our segments with how we currently manage our business, most notably bringing the commercial components of Microsoft 365 together in the Productivity and Business Processes segment. Beginning in fiscal year 2025, the information that our chief operating decision maker is regularly provided and reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance reflects these segment changes.
Additional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 18 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
Our reportable segments are described below.

Azure AI Foundry is a unified platform for developers to design, customize, and manage AI applications and agents. 
Our server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient. Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Server operating system. This includes the server platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software development lifecycle tools for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers. Server products revenue is mainly affected by purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses sold to OEMs, and retail packaged products. CALs provide access rights to certain server products, including SQL Server and Windows Server, and revenue is reported along with the associated server product.

Competition
Azure faces diverse competition from cloud service providers and open source offerings. Azure’s competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. Our AI offerings compete with AI products from hyperscalers, as well as products from other emerging competitors and other open source offerings, many of which are also current or potential partners. Our Azure Security offerings include our cloud security solution and security information and event management solution, which compete with providers in the cybersecurity and cloud security space. We believe our cloud’s global scale, coupled with our broad portfolio of identity and security solutions, allows us to effectively solve complex cybersecurity challenges for our customers and differentiates us from the competition.
Our server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware and nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system.
We compete to provide enterprise-wide computing and point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity, security, hosting, database, and e-business servers.  
Our database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from providers in the data and analytics industry. Our system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers. Our products for software developers compete against offerings from major technology providers, as well as open source alternatives. 
We believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability. 
Our Enterprise and partner services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies. 
More Personal Computing
Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:
•	Windows and Devices, including Windows OEM licensing (Windows Pro and non-Pro licenses sold through the OEM channel) and Devices, comprising Surface and PC accessories.
•	Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content (including games and in-game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, advertising, and other cloud services.
•	Search and news advertising, comprising Bing and Copilot, Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and third-party affiliates.
Windows and Devices
The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by: 
The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.
Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets.
Growth of the AI PC category.
Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.
Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises.
Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel.
Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed.
Constraints in the supply chain of device components.
Piracy.
We design and sell devices, such as Surface (including Copilot+ PCs) and PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft products and services. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers be more productive. Growth in Devices is dependent on total PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product roadmap, and expanding into new categories.
Gaming
Microsoft is expanding how billions of people globally access and play video games on PC, console, mobile, and cloud. Our game content is developed through a collection of first-party studios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences. We continue to invest in gaming studios and content to expand our intellectual property roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of first- and third-party titles. 
The gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We are identifying new opportunities to attract gamers across a variety of different end points through our first- and third-party content and business diversification across subscriptions, ads, and digital stores. We’ve seen new devices from third-party manufacturers along with key PC and mobile end points that help us empower gamers to play in a way that is most convenient to them. We are focused on growing the platform and expanding to new ecosystems to engage as many gamers as possible. 
Xbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other devices. Xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as well as advertising. Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox enabled content, availability of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences. 
Search and News Advertising
Our Search and news advertising business is designed to deliver relevant search, native, and display advertising to a global audience. Microsoft Copilot is a digital companion designed to inform, entertain, and inspire. Our Microsoft Edge browser and Bing search engine with Copilot are key tools to enable user acquisition and engagement, while our technology platform enables accelerated delivery of digital advertising solutions. In addition to first-party tools, we have several partnerships with companies through which we provide and monetize search offerings. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content on advertising offerings.
Competition 
Windows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity. 
Devices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. Many of these manufacturers are also current or potential partners and customers, including our Windows OEMs.
Xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with other console platforms. We believe our gaming platform is effectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.
Our Search and news advertising business competes with search engines, and a wide array of websites, social platforms, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users. 
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of June 30, 2025, we employed approximately 228,000 people on a full-time basis, 125,000 in the U.S. and 103,000 internationally. Of the total employees, 89,000 were in operations, including product support and consulting services, datacenter operations, and manufacturing and distribution; 80,000 were in product research and development; 44,000 were in sales and marketing; and 15,000 were in general and administration. Certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.
We design our programs to attract, reward, and retain top talent while fostering continuous employee development and reinforcing our organizational culture and values. Our total compensation offering is both highly differentiated and competitive within the market, and we also monitor pay equity across multiple dimensions. We have invested significantly in employee wellbeing and offer a differentiated benefits package which includes many physical, emotional, and financial wellness programs. We also provide access to continuous learning through a wide range of internal and external content, supporting professional growth across roles and disciplines. Through our employee listening systems, we gather direct feedback from our workforce, enabling us to adapt our programs and address employee needs globally with real-time insights. Additionally, our culture prioritizes the security of both our customers and Microsoft, embedding this responsibility across all teams and functions.
OPERATIONS
We have regional operations service centers in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East that support our business operations, including customer contract and order processing, billing, credit and collections, customer lifecycle AI and cloud operations, and vendor management and logistics. 
In addition to our operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout each of these regions. We continue to align our datacenter locations and server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components.
We engage third-party manufacturers to produce our devices and have implemented measures to enhance supply chain efficiency and resilience, including the ability to relocate production geographically. 
There are few qualified suppliers for certain components of our servers and devices. Extended or unforeseen disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to operate our datacenters and manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
Product and Service Development 
Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, enter new geographic and product markets, and drive broad adoption of our products and services. We make significant investments in research and development for new and existing products, services, and technologies, including tools and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, security, and operating systems. 
We develop most of our products and services internally which allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before releasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. 
We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities, and as appropriate, we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the results across the company. This includes continuing to support fundamental research, which provides us with a unique perspective on future trends and contributes to our innovation. 
Intellectual Property 
We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property in our products and services, we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting and enabling our external development community. Our engagement with open source software also causes us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations.
While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third-party relating to the development of our products. 
DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING 
Our customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector institutions, service providers, application developers, and OEMs. We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: direct, distributors and resellers, and OEMs. Our sales organization performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises and public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements; supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services; and managing OEM relationships.
Direct 
Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (“Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors” or “ESA”). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales. 
We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. Additionally, our Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries. 
Distributors and Resellers 
Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (“LSP”), distributors, value-added resellers (“VAR”), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services. 
We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support. 
Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services. 
OEMs 
We distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Microsoft 365 Consumer. 
There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft. 
LICENSING OPTIONS 
We offer options for organizations of varying sizes that want to purchase our cloud services and on-premises software. We license these organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. These volume licensing programs have varying programmatic requirements and benefits to best meet the needs of our customers. 
Software Assurance (“SA”) conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools, training, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. SA is required to be purchased with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.
Volume Licensing Programs
Enterprise Agreement 
Enterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
We are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. These requirements are continually evolving, and they can be unclear and vary significantly across jurisdictions. We have implemented comprehensive compliance programs across our operations to adapt to these changes and to maintain customer and regulator confidence. We monitor regulatory developments around the world and implement policies, controls, and technical safeguards so that our operations, products, and services meet applicable legal standards. Our business teams, with legal support, manage the compliance programs and prepare external regulatory and commercial reporting, and our internal audit teams conduct reviews of the programs and processes. While we have a unified approach to regulatory compliance, some of the programs and processes are tailored to meet specific regulatory obligations, such as with the creation of independent compliance functions required by the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act and the EU Digital Services Act, which oversee, monitor, and assess the company’s compliance with these acts.
For a description of the risks we face related to regulatory matters, refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and the trading price of our common stock.
STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS
We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
Competition in the technology sector
Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers, we may not remain competitive, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Competition among platform-based ecosystems
An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to meet consumer demand and to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms.
A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the hardware and software elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as PCs, tablets, smartphones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically-integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. Shifting a portion of our business to a vertically-integrated model may increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.
We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablets. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users continue to turn to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by PCs. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a PC, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our OEM partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.
Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. Competitors’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives.
For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
Business model competition
Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.
A material part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. We and our competitors continue to devote significant resources to developing and deploying cloud-based strategies and services for consumers and business customers, and pricing and delivery models are evolving. 
We are investing in artificial intelligence (“AI”) across the entire company and infusing generative AI capabilities into our consumer and commercial offerings. AI technology and services are a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, and new competitors continue to enter the market. We will bear significant development and operational costs to build and support the AI models, services, platforms, and infrastructure necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To compete effectively we must also be responsive to technological change, new and potential regulatory developments, and public scrutiny.
Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business models, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.
Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at little or no cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.
Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, developing, making available, or using AI models that are open, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source products. Some open source products mimic the features and functionality of our products.
The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our focus on cloud-based and AI services presents execution and competitive risks. We are incurring significant costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud-based and AI services, reducing operating margins. Whether we succeed in cloud-based and AI services depends on our execution in several areas, including:
Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based and AI services and products that generate increasing traffic and market share.
Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based and AI services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices.
Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.
Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations and specific requirements of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.
Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.
It is uncertain whether our strategies will continue to attract users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This could adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our AI systems offer users powerful tools and capabilities. However, there may be instances where these systems are used in ways that are unintended or inappropriate. In addition, some users may also engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based and AI services, such as unauthorized account access, payment fraud, or terms of service violations including cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. While we are committed to detecting and controlling such misuse of our cloud-based and AI services, our efforts may not be effective, and we may incur reputational damage or experience adverse impacts to our business and results of operations.
RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS
We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including AI-based products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, and gaming devices. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovation, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable or may not achieve operating margins as high as we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data-handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. We could experience significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services. These factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances could have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in October 2023 we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”). In January 2023 we announced the third phase of our OpenAI strategic partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. We also have limited ability to control or influence third parties with whom we have arrangements, which may impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits. The success of these transactions and arrangements depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as the acquired companies’ ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, digital safety, responsible AI, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full economic benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We have recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. In addition, an acquisition may be subject to challenge even after it has been completed. These events could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS
Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.
Security of our information technology
Threats to security can take a variety of forms. Threat actors, including individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states, state-sponsored organizations, or cybercriminal groups, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our internal infrastructure, and we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in which such actors have gained unauthorized access to our systems and data, including customer systems and data. These actors use a wide variety of methods, which include developing and deploying malicious software; exploiting known and potential vulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes in our or third-party hardware, software, or other infrastructure to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters; using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose sensitive information, such as passwords, or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data; or acting in a coordinated manner or conducting coordinated attacks. For example, as previously disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 19, 2024 and amended on March 8, 2024, beginning in late November 2023, a nation-state associated threat actor used a password spray attack to compromise a legacy test account and, in turn, gain access to Microsoft email accounts. The threat actor used information it obtained to gain unauthorized access to some of our source code repositories and internal systems, and the threat actor could continue to utilize this and other information to attempt to gain access to our systems or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. This incident has and may continue to result in harm to our reputation and customer relationships. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can sustain malicious activities for extended periods and deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our customers, or our partners have and may continue to intensify due to our transparency to our customers, other stakeholders, and the public about cyberattacks, and during elections or periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict. Challenges or failures in applying security patches to all hardware and devices connected to our systems, including end-of-life and end-of-support equipment, have and may continue to result in unauthorized access to our systems and data in the future. Cyber incidents and attacks, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, and reputation, or expose us to legal or regulatory risk.
Inadequate account security or organizational security practices, including those of companies we have acquired or those of the third parties we utilize, have resulted and may result in unauthorized access to our systems and data, including customer systems and data. For example, passwords may not be rotated and employee access may not be updated or removed on a timely basis. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems or reveal confidential information, and laws in foreign jurisdictions may compel actions by such parties against our interests and could limit our recourse. Malicious actors may employ the supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware.
Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Threat actors may also utilize emerging technologies, such as AI and machine learning. Our current capabilities may not detect certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. It may be difficult to determine the best way to investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate the harm caused by a cyber incident. Such efforts may not be successful, and we may make errors or fail to take necessary actions. It is possible that threat actors may gain undetected access to other networks and systems after establishing a foothold on an internal system. Cyber incidents and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems, as well as those of our partners and customers. In addition, it may take considerable time for us to investigate and evaluate the full impact of incidents, particularly for sophisticated attacks. As a result of these and other factors, we may not be able to provide prompt, full, and reliable information about the incident to our customers, partners, regulators, and the public. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security can disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, actions taken to remediate an incident could result in outages, data losses, and disruptions of our services.
Our internal environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Increasing use of generative AI models in our internal systems may create new attack surfaces or methods for adversaries. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge or the emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide.
Security of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data
The security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us, whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to or attacks on our own infrastructure, such as the nation-state attack described in the prior risk factor, have also affected our customers and may do so in the future. The reliability of our cloud-based services and the protection of customer data depend on the security of our infrastructure, which includes hardware and other elements provided by third parties. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, as well as customers with sensitive data, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers’ on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (“zero-day”) vulnerabilities. Product vulnerabilities can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers’ systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our products or services. Weaknesses in our development processes can result in vulnerabilities in our products. Open source software can also contain vulnerabilities that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks as we increasingly incorporate open source software into our products. Additionally, features that rely on generative AI can be susceptible to security threats.
Our customers operate complex systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers’ vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied sizes and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state-of-the-art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults.
Cyberattacks could adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers’ computing environments.
Any of the foregoing events could result in reputational harm, loss of revenue, increased costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Development and deployment of defensive measures
To defend against security threats to our internal infrastructure, our cloud-based services, and our customers’ systems, we must take a complex and multifaceted approach. This includes continuously engineering more secure products and services, and enhancing security, threat detection, and reliability features. We must also escalate and improve our development processes and the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others in a timely manner. In addition, we must develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, and maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services. Further, we must provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so.
The cost of these measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our processes, products, and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to exercise contractual or other remedies against us, reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers and third parties granted access to customer systems may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, may fail to timely install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government have enhanced or specialized expectations and requirements to which we must develop and engineer our products and services. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.
Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could experience adverse impacts to our results of operations, reputation, or competitive position.
Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. Relatedly, despite our efforts to continuously improve security controls, it is possible that we may fail to identify or mitigate insider threat activities that could lead to the misuse of our systems or customer and user data. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may increase costs or hinder sales of our products and services.
We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.
Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses
For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations, including through the use of AI technologies, dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Other digital safety abuses
Our consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to find, generate, store, or disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale, the limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal frameworks. When discovered by users and others, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives have been enacted to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online, and we expect this to continue with focused attention on child safety. At the same time, regulations and other initiatives regarding freedom of expression may conflict with such content moderation regulations. The legal and regulatory environment in this area is complex and continues to evolve across multiple jurisdictions. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty regarding both current and future compliance obligations. Failure to comply with content requirements may subject us to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our products and services, how they are used by customers, and how third-party products and services interact with them, may present security, privacy, and execution risks. Our products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. For example, customers control our products and services, including our AI products, within their environments, and may deploy them in high-risk scenarios or utilize them inappropriately. Our products may also collect large amounts of data in manners which may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. Our customers also operate complex systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors whose products or personnel may take or fail to take actions which impact the reliability or security of our products and services. If our products and services do not work as intended, are utilized in methods not intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation, or adversely affect our results of operations.
Issues in the development, deployment, and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability. We are building AI into many of our offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making AI available for our customers to use in solutions that they build. This AI may be developed by Microsoft or others, including our strategic partner, OpenAI. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased or inaccurate information. Content generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, inaccurate, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions, cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result in our products and services not working as intended. Human review of certain inputs and outputs may be required, including for agentic AI systems that can take actions autonomously. Our implementation of AI systems could result in legal liability, regulatory action, brand, reputational, or competitive harm, or other adverse impacts. These risks may stem from issues related to intellectual property, data privacy, and other claims associated with AI training and outputs. They are further compounded by the evolving regulatory landscape, with new laws emerging globally, including the European Union (“EU”). Some AI scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society. There is also rising divergence globally in how to address these issues and impacts, with the result that we will need to navigate a web of different tensions across geographies. Finally, if we enable or offer AI solutions that have unintended consequences, unintended usage or customization by our customers and partners, are contrary to our responsible AI policies and practices, or are otherwise controversial because of the impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, our reputation, competitive position, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units and other components. The cost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services, including through the incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, outages, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power or water supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience, resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
We may experience supply or quality problems. There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Capacity available to us may be affected as competitors use some of the same suppliers and materials for hardware components. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Datacenter servers, Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages which could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations. 
Our software products and services also have and may in the future experience quality or reliability problems. The processes we use to develop our software are imperfect. Like all software, our software contains bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent on one another. Our products and services may be impacted by interaction with third-party products and services. Our customers may also utilize their own or third-party products and services whose reliability is dependent on interaction with our products and services. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Weaknesses in our processes could result in defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing, which could cause reduced sales, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.
Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex. Failure to prevent, detect, or address defects in design, manufacture, or associated software could result in recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS
We are subject to a variety of new, existing, and evolving legal and regulatory requirements that could adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, digital accessibility, advertising, and online safety. Laws in several jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, increasingly define certain of our services as regulated services. This trend may continue with our offerings becoming subject to additional data protection, security, digital safety, law enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. Regulators and private litigants may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies. In addition, laws requiring us to retrieve and produce customer data in response to compulsory legal demands from law enforcement and governmental authorities are expanding and the requests we are experiencing are increasing in volume and complexity. 
New, existing, and evolving laws and regulations, or interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our interpretations of such laws and regulations or our practices, may result in modification of our products and services, altered business models and operations, increased costs, reputational damage, and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding: 
Competition laws and new market regulation: Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations and enacting new regulations to intervene in digital markets, and this includes markets such as the EU, the United Kingdom, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. and foreign antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business. Competition law enforcement actions and court decisions along with new market regulations may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes from them. New competition law actions or obligations under market regulation schemes could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent.
AI: Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in AI, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity. For example, the EU’s AI Act may increase costs or impact the provision or operation of our AI models and services in the European market. AI regulatory areas include model and system development and deployment, frontier model safety, transparency, and content provenance. 
Anti-corruption: The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities.
Trade: Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Restrictions on data flows and outbound investment and customer sensitivities may limit our ability to leverage parts of our global engineering footprint to provide services in certain jurisdictions. Increased geopolitical instabilities and changing U.S. Administration priorities create an unpredictable trade landscape. U.S. tariff and shifting AI export controls policies, like the AI Diffusion Rule, could increase operational costs, create uncertainty in the continuity of our products, and accelerate sovereignty initiatives among international partners and customers. The volatility of U.S. tariffs has triggered economic uncertainty and could impact cloud and devices supply chain cost competitiveness. The potential replacement of the recently rescinded AI Diffusion Rule and other potential AI-related rulemakings could adversely affect Microsoft’s business, strategy, and operations. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict like the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict could result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us.
Cybersecurity: Legislative and regulatory actions related to cybersecurity may increase the costs associated with developing, implementing, or securing our products and services. The legal and regulatory environment in this area is complex and continues to evolve across multiple jurisdictions. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty regarding both current and future compliance obligations. This uncertainty increases the risk that we may incur additional operational costs, face regulatory enforcement actions, or encounter challenges in the development and deployment of our products.
Handling of personal data: Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data globally continue to evolve. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies on the movement of data across national boundaries. Data protection authorities and governments in the EU and other markets have and may again restrict and/or block the use of services that involve the transfer of data across borders. New and evolving rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services. In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other similar regulations impose a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. New requirements related to the use of data, including the Data Act, add additional rules and restrictions on the use of data in our products and services.
Environmental, Social, and Governance: Laws, regulations, and policies relating to environmental, social, and governance matters are being developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may include greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage caps, as well as specific, target-driven environmental, social, and governance frameworks and disclosure requirements. In addition, in 2020 we announced goals to become carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030. Any failure or perceived failure to meet our sustainability goals, or to meet various sustainability regulatory requirements, could result in claims and lawsuits, regulatory actions, penalties, or damage to our reputation, each of which could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
How these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change, and sometimes may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, governments’ approach to enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with existing, expanding, or new laws and regulations may involve significant costs and operational efforts, or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect our results of operations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties, criminal sanctions, or orders to cease the alleged noncompliant activity. If our products do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements, we could face regulatory or legal actions, and our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases, AI services, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, employment practices, and regulation. As we continue to expand our business and offerings, we may experience new and novel legal claims. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. An adverse impact to our financial condition and results of operations could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government contracts. Government contracts and regulatory requirements can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we are subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, and we are required to provide assurance and attestations about our products and processes. If we do not satisfy contractual or regulatory requirements, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, cancellations, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These events could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.
We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices and principles, including changes to the global tax framework, in various jurisdictions. In recent years, multiple domestic and international tax proposals were proposed to impose greater tax burdens on large multinational enterprises. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals or guidance in international taxation, including the establishment of a global minimum tax.
We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under IRS audit for prior tax years and have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for the tax years 2004 to 2013. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. The final resolution of the proposed adjustments, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and adversely affect our results of operations in the period or periods in which that determination is made.
We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other global fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS
We face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our business and operating results being harmed. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software, source code, and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. 
Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology. Our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Unauthorized access to or disclosure of source code or other intellectual property also increases the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors.
Third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights, including current copyright infringement and other claims arising from AI training and output. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty-bearing data access or licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. Adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages or injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
GENERAL RISKS
If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and results of operations may be harmed. Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions, public policy positions, or corporate philanthropic initiatives. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:
The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like.
Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, content, or development and deployment of AI.
Data security breaches, cybersecurity incidents, responsible AI failures, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.
Social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees.
Adverse economic or market conditions could harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our results of operations. If demand for computing power, PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.
Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.
We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio could be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems, operations, or supply chain because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations or adversely affect our results of operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential negative consequences of prolonged service outages.
Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose economic and other risks, which may negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers, increase our operating costs, or otherwise disrupt our operations in markets both directly and indirectly impacted by such events. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes could adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in geopolitical conditions also increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors.
The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these Risk Factors.
The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services.
Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers, employees, and infrastructure are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, geopolitical tension, particularly between the U.S. and Europe, restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes, could adversely affect our results of operations. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenue, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the environment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to operate and sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services, impair our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations.
Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting, training, and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as an inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Restraints on the flow of technical and professional talent, including those derived from changes to U.S. immigration policies or laws, may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services could be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some employees in the U.S. and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union. The unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives.
ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 
We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2025 that remain unresolved. 
ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
RISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY
Microsoft plays a central role in the world’s digital ecosystem. We have made it the top corporate priority to protect the computing environment used by our customers and employees and to support the resiliency of our cloud infrastructure and services, products, devices, and our internal corporate resources from determined adversaries. In response to the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape, we launched the Secure Future Initiative (“SFI”) in November 2023 and expanded the scope of SFI in May 2024. The SFI focuses our business strategy and efforts on continual improvement in cybersecurity protection, and is aligned around three security principles:	
Secure by Design: Security comes first when designing any product or service. 
Secure by Default: Security protections are enabled and enforced by default, require no extra effort, and are not optional. 
Secure Operations: Security controls and monitoring will continuously be improved to meet current and future threats. 
We operate a cybersecurity program and governance framework designed to protect our computing environments against cybersecurity threats, and we have controls, policies, and procedures to identify, manage, and mitigate cybersecurity threats. Annually, we assess our cybersecurity program’s alignment with the National Institute of Standards & Technology’s Cyber Security Framework (“NIST”) and other applicable industry standards. We also undertake integrated planning and preparedness activities to support business continuity and operational resiliency. We assess our program's effectiveness through various exercises, including tabletop simulations and production environment tests, penetration and vulnerability tests, red team exercises, and other related activities. We conduct mandatory cybersecurity training, provide employees with tools to report suspected incidents and assess their own security posture, and conduct real-time simulated employee education exercises, such as phishing email campaigns designed to emulate real-world attacks. We also engage in robust cybersecurity assessments and remediation efforts for acquired companies. 
Our computing environments, products, and services are reviewed by our internal audit teams as well as independent third-party assessors. We are committed to managing the most significant risks to our strategies and ambitions, including cybersecurity risks. The Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) organization supports management in this commitment by facilitating the semiannual risk assessment, which documents the priority and status of these risks and aligns them with our strategic mitigation efforts. ERM is structured using a framework based on the Committee of Sponsoring Organization (“COSO”) guidance on Enterprise Risk Management Integrating Strategy with Performance and it also aligns with the International Organization for Standardization 31000:2018 Risk Management Standard.
We continuously monitor our computing environments, products, and services for vulnerabilities and signs of compromise, and we utilize our own security products to combat cybersecurity threats. We integrate security into our computing environments, products, and services through our Security Development Lifecycle (“SDL”). Our SDL introduces security and privacy considerations throughout all phases of our development process and through the adoption of zero-trust end-to-end architecture. We utilize machine learning and AI-powered security tools to gain insights from 84 trillion signals per day. We track over 1,500 unique threat actors, including more than 600 nation-state actors, 300 cybercriminal groups, 200 influence operation groups, and hundreds of others. To support our efforts, we operate a Cyber Defense Operations Center connected to over 10,000 security and threat intelligence experts, including engineers, researchers, data scientists, cybersecurity experts, threat hunters, geopolitical analysts, investigators, and frontline responders across the globe.
When appropriate, we utilize external service providers to assess, test, or otherwise assist our program. We also leverage third parties by working with external researchers, operating bug bounty programs, and managing coordinated vulnerability disclosure programs with security organizations. We maintain a systematic approach to assessing and controlling the cybersecurity risks presented by third-party service providers. We require third-party service providers to manage their cybersecurity risks in defined ways, undergo cybersecurity reviews, notify us of cyber events, and satisfy additional contractual requirements.
We seek to improve the entire cybersecurity ecosystem through multistakeholder diplomacy to set and uphold expectations for state behavior, advancement of government policy that strengthens cybersecurity and resiliency, disruption and deterrence of cybercrime, protection of national security interests, and disruption of digital threats to democracies. We also establish processes and innovate solutions for us and our customers to address the growing number and complexity of cybersecurity regulations.
When we experience a cybersecurity incident, we utilize our well-established incident response plans that operate both across the company and at the product and services level. Incidents are first triaged for severity, and then more deeply assessed to establish a plan of record and activate internal and external notification, disclosure, and communication plans, as applicable. Engineering and development resources are mobilized to resolve or remediate the incident. After the incident is resolved, a comprehensive post-incident review process is conducted.
We describe the risks from cybersecurity threats, including previous cybersecurity incidents, in section “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). As of the date of this Form 10-K, we do not believe any risks from cybersecurity threats have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our results of operations or financial condition. However, the cybersecurity threat environment is increasingly challenging, and we, along with the entire digital ecosystem, are under constant and increasing threat. As discussed above, our business strategy is tied to the SFI and we are committed to continuously monitoring cybersecurity threats, enhancing the security of our products, investing in our cybersecurity infrastructure, and collaborating with peers, customers, service providers, regulators, and governments to advance our and the entire digital ecosystem’s cybersecurity defenses and resiliency.
GOVERNANCE
Our Board of Directors oversees cybersecurity risk. Cybersecurity reviews by the Board are scheduled to occur at least quarterly, or more frequently as determined to be necessary or advisable. Presentations to the Board of Directors are made by senior management, including our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), our EVP of Microsoft Security, our EVP of Cloud + AI, and the head of our Customer Security and Trust organization. The presentations address topics such as cybersecurity threats, incidents, top risks and related remediation efforts, results from internal and third-party assessments, progress towards risk-mitigation goals, the functioning of our incident response program, regulatory developments, and digital diplomacy efforts. In addition, we have an escalation process in place to inform senior management and the Board of significant issues. Cybersecurity issues are also considered during separate Board meeting discussions regarding important matters like ERM, audit issues, operational budgeting, business continuity planning, mergers and acquisitions, brand management, and other relevant matters.
Our CISO leads the strategy, engineering, and operations of cybersecurity across the company, and reports to the EVP of Cloud + AI. Our CISO has extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and cybersecurity risk. Before joining Microsoft, our CISO served in a prior Chief Technology Officer role as well as in senior leadership, engineering, and operational roles within multiple organizations. In addition to the Board’s oversight of cybersecurity risk, to support the CISO, we have established a Cybersecurity Governance Council (“CGC”) charged with overseeing initiatives that safeguard Microsoft’s computing environments, products, and services. The CGC is comprised of an executive-level team of Deputy CISOs with cybersecurity backgrounds and expertise relevant to their roles. The CGC responsibilities include approving our enterprise security risk assessment process and results, determining the appropriate cybersecurity risk level and mitigations, reviewing the NIST CSF alignment, and supporting compliance with cybersecurity regulations. Our cybersecurity efforts are supported directly by Microsoft’s security and threat intelligence experts and our employees across the company, all of whom receive cybersecurity awareness training and education and are expected to support our efforts.

OVERVIEW
Microsoft is a technology company committed to making digital technology and artificial intelligence (“AI”) available broadly and doing so responsibly, with a mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We create platforms and tools, powered by AI, that deliver innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers. 
We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; supporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes.
Highlights from fiscal year 2025 compared with fiscal year 2024 included:
•	Microsoft Cloud revenue increased 23% to $168.9 billion.
•	Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 14% driven by Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue growth of 15%.
•	Microsoft 365 Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 11% driven by Microsoft 365 Consumer cloud revenue growth of 11%. 
•	LinkedIn revenue increased 9%.
•	Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 15% driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 19%.
•	Server products and cloud services revenue increased 23% driven by Azure and other cloud services revenue growth of 34%.
•	Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 3%.
•	Xbox content and services revenue increased 16%.
•	Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 20%.
Industry Trends and Opportunities
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.
Microsoft and OpenAI maintain a long-term strategic partnership originally established in 2019. Microsoft is a major investor in OpenAI, and the companies have reciprocal revenue-sharing arrangements. We hold rights to OpenAI’s intellectual property, including models and infrastructure, for integration into our products. The OpenAI API is exclusive to Azure, runs on Azure, and is available through the Azure OpenAI Service. We also have a right of first refusal on OpenAI's new capacity needs. 
Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks
The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.
The investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. 
Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have a material impact on reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2025.
Further, global, regional, and local economic developments and changes in global trade policies such as restrictions on international trade, including tariffs and other controls on imports or exports, could result in increased supply chain challenges, cost volatility, and consumer and economic uncertainty which may adversely affect our results of operations.
Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.
Seasonality
Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Fourth quarter revenue is driven by a higher volume of multi-year contracts executed during the period. 
Reportable Segments
We report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. 
In August 2024, we announced changes to the composition of our segments. These changes align our segments with how we currently manage our business, most notably bringing the commercial components of Microsoft 365 together in the Productivity and Business Processes segment. Beginning in fiscal year 2025, the information that our chief operating decision maker is regularly provided and reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance reflects these segment changes. Prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business during fiscal year 2025.
Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 18 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). 
Metrics
We use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. We disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year.
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we made updates to our metrics in connection with the segment changes described above. These changes align our metrics with how we manage and monitor certain businesses. The key change was bringing the commercial components of Microsoft 365 together and creating a new Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue growth metric. Other changes include combining Windows OEM and Devices into a single revenue growth metric that brings revenue from PC market-driven businesses together, as well as elevating our cloud revenue growth metrics to align to our strategic focus on cloud growth. 
Commercial
Our commercial business primarily consists of Server products and cloud services, Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics products and cloud services, and Enterprise and partner services. Our commercial metrics allow management and investors to assess the overall health of our commercial business and include leading indicators of future performance.
Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud
Metrics related to our Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments assess the health of our core businesses within these segments. The metrics primarily reflect growth across our cloud services.
More Personal Computing
Metrics related to our More Personal Computing segment assess the performance of our key consumer businesses.

General and administrative expenses decreased $386 million or 5% driven by Gaming, including the impact of the Activision Blizzard acquisition.
OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET 
The components of other income (expense), net were as follows: 
We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.
Fiscal Year 2025 Compared with Fiscal Year 2024
Interest and dividends income decreased primarily due to lower portfolio balances. Interest expense decreased primarily due to maturities of commercial paper and higher capitalization of debt interest expense, offset in part by higher finance lease interest expense. Net recognized losses on investments increased primarily due to higher impairments, offset in part by higher gains on equity investments in the current period. Net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to higher losses on equity derivatives in the current period. Other, net primarily reflects net recognized losses on equity method investments, including OpenAI.
INCOME TAXES 
Effective Tax Rate
Our effective tax rate for both fiscal years 2025 and 2024 was 18%. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was primarily impacted by changes in the mix of our earnings and tax expenses between the U.S. and foreign countries.
Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.
The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2025, our U.S. income before income taxes was $69.2 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $54.4 billion. In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) published its model rules “Tax Challenges Arising From the Digitalisation of the Economy - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)” which established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which applies to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. While we do not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as countries implement legislation and the OECD provides additional guidance.
We are currently assessing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) which was enacted on July 4, 2025. The OBBBA provides a U.S. global intangible low-taxed income effective tax rate of 14% effective fiscal year 2027 for Microsoft. It also provides bonus depreciation for certain assets placed into service after January 19, 2025 and an election to expense U.S. incurred research or experimental expenditures.
Uncertain Tax Positions
We remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2025, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS’s administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S., some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our operations in Ireland remain subject to examination for tax years 2020 and thereafter.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. 
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments 
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $94.6 billion and $75.5 billion as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Equity and other investments were $15.4 billion and $14.6 billion as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.
Valuation 
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. 
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. 
Cash Flows 
Cash from operations increased $17.6 billion to $136.2 billion for fiscal year 2025, primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees and cash used to pay income taxes. Cash used in financing increased $13.9 billion to $51.7 billion for fiscal year 2025, primarily due to a $9.5 billion increase in cash used for repayments of debt, net of proceeds. Cash used in investing decreased $24.4 billion to $72.6 billion for fiscal year 2025, primarily due to a $63.2 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired and divestitures, and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $22.3 billion increase in cash used in net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and a $20.1 billion increase in additions to property and equipment.
Debt Proceeds
We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. Refer to Note 10 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
Unearned Revenue 
Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include cloud services and Software Assurance (“SA”). Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2025:
If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. Refer to Note 12 – Unearned Revenue of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2025:
(a)	Refer to Note 10 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
(b)	Refer to Note 6 – Property and Equipment of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
(c)	Refer to Note 13 – Leases of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
(d)	Purchase commitments primarily relate to datacenters and include open purchase orders and take-or-pay contracts that are not presented as construction commitments above.
Income Taxes
As a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. As of June 30, 2025, our eighth transition tax installment of $4.4 billion is short-term and payable in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.
Share Repurchases 
During fiscal years 2025 and 2024, we repurchased 31 million shares and 32 million shares of our common stock for $13.0 billion and $12.0 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase program. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of June 30, 2025, $57.3 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program. Refer to Note 15 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
Dividends 
During fiscal years 2025 and 2024, our Board of Directors declared dividends totaling $24.7 billion and $22.3 billion, respectively. We intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Refer to Note 15 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
Other Planned Uses of Capital 
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We will continue to invest in capital expenditures to support growth in our cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure and training. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, and income taxes.
Revenue Recognition 
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. 
Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price (“SSP") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. 
In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. 
Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. 
Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. 
Impairment of Investment Securities 
We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. 
Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net. 
Goodwill 
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. 
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. 
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. 
Research and Development Costs 
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a software product to be marketed or sold to external users are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. 
Legal and Other Contingencies 	
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes 
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 
STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits. 
The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. 
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
RISKS
We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currencies
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. Principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.
Interest Rate
Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices.
Credit
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices to facilitate portfolio diversification.
Equity
Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting Principles 
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
Recast of Certain Prior Period Information 
In August 2024, we announced changes to the composition of our segments. These changes align our segments with how we currently manage our business, most notably bringing the commercial components of Microsoft 365 together in the Productivity and Business Processes segment. Beginning in fiscal year 2025, the information that our chief operating decision maker is regularly provided and reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance reflects these segment changes. Prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business during fiscal year 2025. These changes primarily impacted Note 8 – Goodwill, Note 12 – Unearned Revenue, and Note 18 – Segment Information and Geographic Data. 
The recast of prior period information had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements. 
Estimates and Assumptions 
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.
Foreign Currencies 
Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income. 
Revenue
Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue 
Product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. 
Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and gaming; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. 
Nature of Products and Services
Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.
Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. 
Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. 
Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. 
Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. 
Refer to Note 18 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering.
Significant Judgments
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.
Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. 
In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. 
Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. 
Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.
Contract Balances and Other Receivables 
Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. 
Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include cloud services and SA. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. 
Refer to Note 12 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.
Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.
As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $5.2 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, other receivables related to activities to facilitate the purchase of server components were $8.2 billion and $10.5 billion, respectively, and are included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
We record financing receivables when we offer certain customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, our financing receivables, net were $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
We record an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of credit losses inherent in the accounts receivable and financing receivable balances. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.
Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer	
We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales organization compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.
Cost of Revenue 
Cost of revenue includes: costs incurred to support and maintain cloud-based and other online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; traffic acquisition costs to drive traffic to our websites and to acquire online advertising space; and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. 
Research and Development 
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs and the depreciation and amortization of assets used to conduct research and development. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. 
Sales and Marketing 
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $2.1 billion, $1.7 billion, and $904 million in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 
Stock-Based Compensation 
Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.
Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.
Income Taxes 
Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets. 
Financial Instruments
Investments
We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.
Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.
Investments that are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are evaluated to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, in which case we would be required to consolidate the entity. We evaluate whether we have (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We have determined we are not the primary beneficiary of any of our VIE investments. Therefore, our VIE investments are not consolidated and the majority are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We have an investment in OpenAI Global, LLC (“OpenAI”) and have made total funding commitments of $13 billion. The investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Derivatives
Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.
For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.
For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.
Fair Value Measurements
We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:
Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.
Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts.
Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.
We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.
Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: software developed or acquired for internal use, three years; computer equipment, two to six years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 15 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated. 
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. 
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. 
Intangible Assets 
Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized over the estimated useful life in proportion to the economic benefits received. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. 
Related Party Transactions
In March 2024, we entered into an agreement with Inflection AI, Inc. (“Inflection”), pursuant to which we obtained a non-exclusive license to Inflection’s intellectual property. Reid Hoffman, a member of our Board of Directors, is a co-founder of and serves on the board of directors of Inflection. As of the date of the agreement with Inflection, Reprogrammed Interchange LLC (“Reprogrammed”) and entities affiliated with Greylock Ventures (“Greylock”) each held less than a 10% equity interest in Inflection. Mr. Hoffman may be deemed to beneficially own the shares held by Reprogrammed and Greylock by virtue of his relationship with such entities. Mr. Hoffman did not participate in any portions of the meetings of our Board of Directors or any committee thereof to review and approve the transaction with Inflection.
Recent Accounting Guidance
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
Segment Reporting – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new standard to improve reportable segment disclosures. The guidance expands the disclosures required for reportable segments in our annual and interim consolidated financial statements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. We adopted the standard beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2025. The adoption resulted in incremental segment reporting disclosures, most notably disclosure of cost of revenue and operating expenses for each reportable segment. Refer to Note 18 – Segment Information and Geographic Data.
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
Income Taxes – Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
In December 2023, the FASB issued a new standard to improve income tax disclosures. The guidance requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standardized categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. The standard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2026, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our income tax disclosures. 
Income Statement – Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
In November 2024, the FASB issued a new standard to expand disclosures about income statement expenses. The guidance requires disaggregation of certain costs and expenses included in each relevant expense caption on our consolidated income statements in a separate note to the financial statements at each interim and annual reporting period, including amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization. The standard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2028 and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our disclosures. 
NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. 
The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows: 
Anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods presented.
NOTE 3 — OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET 
The components of other income (expense), net were as follows: 
Other, net primarily reflects net recognized losses on equity method investments, including OpenAI.
Net Recognized Gains (Losses) on Investments

(a)	Refer to Note 5 – Derivatives for further information on the fair value of our derivative instruments.
Equity investments presented as “Other” in the tables above include investments without readily determinable fair values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments, measured using the equity method, or measured at fair value using net asset value as a practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, equity investments without readily determinable fair values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments were $2.9 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Equity investments measured using the equity method were $6.0 billion as of both June 30, 2025 and 2024.
Unrealized Losses on Debt Investments 
Debt investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:
Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence. 
Debt Investment Maturities 
The following table outlines maturities of our debt investments as of June 30, 2025:
NOTE 5 — DERIVATIVES 
We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 
Foreign Currencies 
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. 
Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.
Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. 
Interest Rate 
Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.
Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using option, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.
Equity 
Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.
Credit 
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.
Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features 
Certain counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2025, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.
The following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments measured in U.S. dollar equivalents:
Fair Values of Derivative Instruments
The following table presents our derivative instruments:
Gross derivative assets and liabilities subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements for which we have elected to offset were $452 million and $1.8 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2025, and $304 million and $800 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2024.
The following table presents the fair value of our derivatives instruments on a gross basis:
Gains (losses) on derivative instruments recognized in other income (expense), net were as follows:
Gains (losses), net of tax, on derivative instruments recognized in our consolidated comprehensive income statements were as follows:
NOTE 6 — PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 
The components of property and equipment were as follows: 
During fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, depreciation expense was $22.0 billion, $15.2 billion, and $11.0 billion, respectively. 
As of June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, purchases of property and equipment remaining in accounts payable were $6.9 billion, $4.3 billion, and $3.8 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2025, we have committed $32.1 billion for the construction of new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements, primarily related to datacenters. 
NOTE 7 — BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
Activision Blizzard, Inc.
On October 13, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”) for a total purchase price of $75.4 billion, consisting primarily of cash. Activision Blizzard is a leader in game development and an interactive entertainment content publisher. The acquisition will accelerate the growth in our gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud gaming. The financial results of Activision Blizzard have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. Activision Blizzard is reported as part of our More Personal Computing segment.
The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was completed as of September 30, 2024. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have allocated the purchase price were as follows:
Goodwill was assigned to our More Personal Computing segment. The goodwill was primarily attributed to increased synergies that are expected to be achieved from the integration of Activision Blizzard. Substantially all of the goodwill is expected to be non-deductible for income tax purposes.
Following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired:
Following are the supplemental consolidated financial results of Microsoft Corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the acquisition had been consummated on July 1, 2022:
These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. They are not the results that would have been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods. The pro forma results include adjustments related to purchase accounting, primarily amortization of intangible assets. Acquisition costs and other nonrecurring charges were immaterial and are included in the earliest period presented.
NOTE 8 — GOODWILL 
Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows:
We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies for further information.
The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined.
Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as “Other” in the table above. Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.
As discussed in Note 1 – Accounting Policies, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 we made changes to our segments. These segment changes also resulted in changes to our reporting units. We reallocated goodwill across impacted reporting units using a relative fair value approach. In addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed. 
Goodwill Impairment
We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses. 
No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2025, May 1, 2024, or May 1, 2023 tests. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, accumulated goodwill impairment was $11.3 billion.
NOTE 9 — INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
The components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows: 
No material impairments of intangible assets were identified during fiscal years 2025, 2024, or 2023. We estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets. 
The components of intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as follows: 
Intangible assets amortization expense was $6.0 billion, $4.8 billion, and $2.5 billion for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 
The following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held as of June 30, 2025:
NOTE 10 — DEBT 
Short-term Debt
As of June 30, 2025, we had no commercial paper issued or outstanding. As of June 30, 2024, we had $6.7 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.4% and maturities ranging from 28 days to 152 days. The estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value.
Long-term Debt
The components of long-term debt were as follows:
(a)	Refer to Note 5 – Derivatives for further information on the interest rate swaps related to fixed-rate debt.
As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the estimated fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $40.4 billion and $42.3 billion, respectively. The estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs. 
Debt in the table above is comprised of senior unsecured obligations and ranks equally with our other outstanding obligations. Interest is paid semi-annually, except for the Euro-denominated debt, which is paid annually. Cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 was $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively. 
The following table outlines maturities of our long-term debt, including the current portion, as of June 30, 2025: 
NOTE 11 — INCOME TAXES
Provision for Income Taxes
The components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: 
U.S. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows: 
Effective Tax Rate
The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows: 
The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland. In fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, our foreign regional operating center in Ireland, which is taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. rate, generated 81%, 83%, and 81% of our foreign income before tax. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax, and in fiscal year 2024, includes tax benefits from tax law changes. In fiscal year 2024, tax benefits from tax law changes primarily relate to the delay of the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations. In fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024 was due to changes in the mix of our earnings and tax expenses between the U.S. and foreign countries. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the delay of the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations.
The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:
Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered. 
As of June 30, 2025, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $390 million, $836 million, and $2.6 billion, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards have varying expiration dates ranging from fiscal year 2026 to 2045 or indefinite carryforward periods, if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2025, we had $816 million federal capital loss carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes. The federal capital loss carryforwards will expire in fiscal year 2030 if not utilized.
The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards, federal capital loss carryforwards, and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. 
Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $28.7 billion, $23.4 billion, and $23.1 billion in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 
Uncertain Tax Positions
Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, were $24.7 billion, $22.8 billion, and $17.1 billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 by $21.2 billion, $19.6 billion, and $14.4 billion, respectively.
As of June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $8.2 billion, $6.8 billion, and $5.2 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 included interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $1.3 billion, $1.5 billion, and $918 million, respectively, net of income tax benefits.
The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were as follows: 
We remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2025, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS’s administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S., some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our operations in Ireland remain subject to examination for tax years 2020 and thereafter.
NOTE 12 — UNEARNED REVENUE 
Unearned revenue by segment was as follows: 
We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies for further information.
Changes in unearned revenue were as follows: 
Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $375 billion as of June 30, 2025, of which $368 billion is related to the commercial portion of revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 40% of our total company remaining performance obligation revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter.
NOTE 13 — LEASES 
We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of less than 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.
The components of lease expense were as follows:
Supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:
Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:
The following table outlines maturities of our lease liabilities as of June 30, 2025:
As of June 30, 2025, we had additional leases, primarily for datacenters, that had not yet commenced of $92.7 billion. These leases will commence between fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2031 with lease terms of 1 year to 20 years.
NOTE 14 — CONTINGENCIES
Irish Data Protection Commission Matter
In 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn’s targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In October 2024, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a final decision alleging GDPR violations and assessing a fine. In November 2024, LinkedIn appealed the final decision to the Irish courts, and the next hearing is scheduled for December 2025.
Other Contingencies
We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.
As of June 30, 2025, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $541 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.
NOTE 15 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY 
Shares Outstanding 
Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: 
Share Repurchases 
On September 14, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $60.0 billion in share repurchases. This share repurchase program commenced in November 2021 and was completed in April 2025.
On September 16, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $60.0 billion in share repurchases.

Our Board of Directors declared the following dividends: 
The dividend declared on June 10, 2025 was included in other current liabilities as of June 30, 2025. 
NOTE 16 — ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)
The following table summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component:
NOTE 17 — EMPLOYEE STOCK AND SAVINGS PLANS
We grant stock-based compensation to employees and directors. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. We issue new shares of Microsoft common stock to satisfy vesting of awards granted under our stock plans. We also have an ESPP for all eligible employees.
Stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as follows: 
Stock Plans
Stock awards entitle the holder to receive shares of Microsoft common stock as the award vests. Stock awards generally vest over a service period of four years or five years. 
Executive Incentive Plan 
Under the Executive Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee approves stock awards to executive officers and certain senior executives. RSUs generally vest ratably over a service period of four years. PSUs generally vest over a performance period of three years. The number of shares the PSU holder receives is based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved.
Activity for All Stock Plans 
The fair value of stock awards was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:
During fiscal year 2025, the following activity occurred under our stock plans: 
(a)	Includes 1 million of PSUs granted at target and performance adjustments above target levels for each of the fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023.
As of June 30, 2025, total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock awards were $21.6 billion. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of three years. The weighted average grant-date fair value of stock awards granted was $413.90, $339.46, and $252.59 for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The fair value of stock awards vested was $16.2 billion, $16.0 billion, and $11.9 billion, for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. As of June 30, 2025, an aggregate of 98 million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
We have an ESPP for all eligible employees. Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last trading day of each three-month period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. 
Employees purchased the following shares during the periods presented:
As of June 30, 2025, 62 million shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance through the ESPP. 
Savings Plans 
We have savings plans in the U.S. that qualify under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. Eligible U.S. employees may contribute a portion of their salary into the savings plans, subject to certain limitations. We match a portion of each dollar a participant contributes into the plans. Employer-funded retirement benefits for all plans were $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and were expensed as contributed.
NOTE 18 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA
In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), who is also our Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements. The primary profitability measure used by the CODM to review segment operating results is operating income. The CODM uses operating income to allocate resources during our annual planning process and throughout the year, as well as to assess the performance of our segments, primarily by monitoring actual results compared to prior periods and expected results. During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. 
We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies for further information.
Our reportable segments are described below. 
Productivity and Business Processes
Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises:
•	Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services, including Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud, comprising Microsoft 365 Commercial, Enterprise Mobility + Security, the cloud portion of Windows Commercial, the per-user portion of Power BI, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance, and Microsoft 365 Copilot; and Microsoft 365 Commercial products, comprising Windows Commercial on-premises and Office licensed on-premises.
•	Microsoft 365 Consumer products and cloud services, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions, Office licensed on-premises, and other consumer services.
•	LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.
•	Dynamics products and cloud services, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP, CRM, Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM applications.
Intelligent Cloud
Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:
•	Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services, comprising cloud and AI consumption-based services, GitHub cloud services, Nuance Healthcare cloud services, virtual desktop offerings, and other cloud services; and Server products, comprising SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”), and other on-premises offerings.
•	Enterprise and partner services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional services, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.
More Personal Computing
Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:
•	Windows and Devices, including Windows OEM licensing (Windows Pro and non-Pro licenses sold through the OEM channel) and Devices, comprising Surface and PC accessories.
•	Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content (including games and in-game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, advertising, and other cloud services.
•	Search and news advertising, comprising Bing and Copilot, Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and third-party affiliates.
Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.
In addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to our segments. These allocated costs generally include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and support, and severance incurred as part of a corporate program. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated and is generally based on relative gross margin or relative headcount.
Segment revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and operating income were as follows during the periods presented:
No sales to an individual customer or country other than the United States accounted for more than 10% of revenue for fiscal years 2025, 2024, or 2023. Revenue, classified by the major geographic areas in which our customers were located, was as follows:
(a)	Includes billings to OEMs and certain multinational organizations because of the nature of these businesses and the impracticability of determining the geographic source of the revenue. 
Revenue, classified by significant product and service offerings, was as follows: 
Our Microsoft Cloud revenue, which includes Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud, Azure and other cloud services, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, and Dynamics 365, was $168.9 billion, $137.7 billion, and $111.6 billion in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. These amounts are included in Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services, Server products and cloud services, LinkedIn, and Dynamics products and cloud services in the table above.
Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment. It is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss.
Long-lived assets, excluding financial instruments and tax assets, classified by the location of the controlling statutory company and with countries over 10% of the total shown separately, were as follows:
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity, for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 30, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Revenue Recognition – Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs.
Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for certain customer agreements, and includes the following:
Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-based services.
The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation.
Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized (e.g., variable consideration, optional purchases, and free services). 
Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that are not sold separately.
Given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management's judgments in determining revenue recognition for certain customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our principal audit procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition for certain customer agreements included the following:
We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the determination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.
We evaluated management's significant accounting policies related to certain customer agreements for reasonableness.
We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:
Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement.
Tested management's identification and treatment of contract terms. 
Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management's application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.
We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services that are not sold separately.
We tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements.
Income Taxes – Uncertain Tax Positions – Refer to Note 11 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. During fiscal year 2024, the Company received Notices of Proposed Adjustments (“NOPAs”) for the tax years 2004 to 2013, primarily related to intercompany transfer pricing. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. 
Conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of certain transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management’s estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our principal audit procedures to evaluate management’s estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following:
We evaluated management’s methods and assumptions used in the measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls.
We tested the reasonableness of management’s judgments regarding the future resolution of uncertain tax positions, as follows:
We evaluated whether management had appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the measurement of the uncertain tax positions.
We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimates by considering how changes in tax law, including statutes, regulations, and recent case law, impacted management’s judgments.
We evaluated the appropriateness of the disclosures in relation to the underlying facts, judgments, and conclusions.

Not applicable. 
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected. 
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2025. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025; their report is included in Item 9A. 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2025, of the Company and our report dated July 30, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Exhibit 10.7 
AMENDED AND RESTATED 
OFFICERS’ INDEMNIFICATION TRUST AGREEMENT 
This AMENDED AND RESTATED OFFICERS’ INDEMNIFICATION TRUST AGREEMENT (this “Trust” or this “Agreement”) is amended and restated effective as of June 30, 2025 (the “Effective Date”), between MICROSOFT CORPORATION, a Washington corporation (“Grantor”), and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the “Trustee”), whose address is 601 Travis Street, Houston, Texas 77002, and, as an additional party, Hugh F. Johnston (the “Beneficiaries’ Representative”). 
RECITALS 
A. Grantor established this Trust and its predecessors to be a source of indemnification for Grantor’s Officers who are eligible for indemnification as stated in this Trust as it is in effect from time to time. 
B. Grantor has determined, after due diligence, that it has and will continue to derive substantial economic benefits from this Trust, including from economic terms that are more favorable to Grantor than obtaining protection for its Officers through the current director and officer insurance market.
C. Grantor’s Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles”) provide for mandatory indemnification of Grantor’s Officers (as defined in the Articles) to the maximum extent provided by law, and as such, this Trust is not an exclusive source of indemnification for the Officers as covered in this Agreement. 
D. Grantor has determined that the Trust continues to be necessary in order for Grantor to attract and retain the most qualified Officers. Grantor has also determined to increase the Minimum Balance to reflect current market conditions. 
E. This Agreement amends, restates and replaces the 2016 Officers’ Indemnification Trust Agreement dated June 30, 2016 established by Grantor, with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee therein and Charles H. Noski as Beneficiaries’ Representative therein (the “2016 Trust”). Grantor’s Board of Directors has acted by resolution adopted June 11, 2025 to amend and restate the 2016 Trust effective as of the Effective Date. Pursuant to an Assumption of Beneficiaries’ Representative Obligations Under Amended and Restated Directors’ Indemnification Trust Agreement, date as of December 4, 2019, Hugh F. Johnston agreed to serve as the successor Beneficiaries’ Representative under the Amended and Restated Indemnification Trust Agreement.
F. The 2016 Trust replaced the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement dated June 28, 2009 (the “2009 Trust”), which replaced the Trust Agreement dated June 1, 1993 established by Grantor, with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., successor in interest to BNY Western Trust Company, as Trustee therein and Charles Noski as Beneficiaries’ Representative therein (the “1993 Trust” and together with the 2009 Trust and 2016 Trust, the “Previous Trusts”). 
G. This Trust also is designed to provide continuing coverage for the “executive officers” as such term is used in the 1993 Trust as such coverage was effective upon execution of the 2016 Trust, with such coverage to overlap with the 1993 Trust for certain officers of Grantor prior to termination of the 1993 Trust. 
H. Except as otherwise noted, the capitalized terms have the meaning ascribed to them in the body of this Agreement. 
AGREEMENT 
NOW, THEREFORE, Grantor will transfer to the Trustee funds as provided on Exhibit A of this Agreement and the Trustee acknowledges the Minimum Balance on the Effective Date, accepts the trust created hereby and agrees that it will hold all property which it may receive hereunder, as custodian IN TRUST, for the purposes and upon the terms and conditions hereinafter stated, and Grantor, the Trustee and the Beneficiaries’ Representative agree as follows:

Rights to coverage as a Beneficiary under this Agreement shall be deemed to vest with and upon such person’s appointment as an Officer. If a Beneficiary of this Trust was also a “Beneficiary” of the 1993 Trust prior to its termination and the 2009 Trust and the 2016 Trust, such person shall be covered by this Trust as a Beneficiary hereunder for Covered Acts as defined herein and also as to “Covered Acts” under such prior trust agreements that occurred prior to the Effective Date. 
2.2	Nonexclusive Remedy. The rights of Beneficiaries to indemnification from this Trust are limited to the assets of the Trust, but this does not limit any Beneficiary’s rights, if any, to indemnification (without duplication) from Grantor, or other Grantor arrangements or obligations, including but not limited to any applicable insurance coverage. 
ARTICLE 3 
THE BENEFICIARIES AND THE 
BENEFICIARIES’ REPRESENTATIVE 
3.1	The Beneficiaries. All present and future Officers as well as any executive officers of Grantor who were “Beneficiaries” of the Previous Trusts (for Covered Acts as defined herein during their employment as an executive officer of Grantor as provided in the Previous Trusts) shall be “Beneficiaries” of this Trust (and each a “Beneficiary”), provided, however, that if there is a Change of Control of Grantor, no Officers appointed after or in connection with such Change of Control shall be entitled to be Beneficiaries who were not Beneficiaries under this Agreement, the 2016 Trust, the 2009 Trust or the 1993 Trust prior to such Change of Control. For purposes of this Agreement, “Change of Control” shall mean (a) a tender offer or exchange offer in which the purpose of such offer is to take over and control Grantor and such offer is accepted by owners of securities of Grantor representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of Grantor’s then outstanding voting securities, (b) Grantor is merged or consolidated with another corporation and as a result of such merger or consolidation less than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving or resulting corporation shall then be owned in the aggregate by the former shareholders of Grantor, (c) Grantor transfers substantially all of its assets to another corporation which is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of Grantor, or (d) during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, individuals who at the beginning of such twelve (12) month period were directors of Grantor cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of Grantor’s Board of Directors. The Beneficiaries’ Representative shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of a Change of Control. Any Beneficiary shall remain a Beneficiary despite his or her resignation, removal, or other failure to continue to be an Officer during the term of this Agreement as to Covered Acts during such Beneficiary’s service as an Officer or as an executive officer under the 1993 Trust. A person whose conduct gives rise to a right of indemnification both as a member of the Board of Directors and as an Officer of Grantor, shall be a Beneficiary hereunder as to all such conduct without being required to separate his or her activities between the role of Director and the role of Officer. 
3.2	New Beneficiaries. If prior to a Change of Control an individual is appointed as an Officer by Grantor’s Board of Directors, Grantor agrees to notify the Trustee and the Beneficiaries’ Representative promptly of such appointment; provided, however, Grantor’s failure to so notify the Trustee and the Beneficiaries’ Representative shall not affect in any way an individual Officer’s rights as a Beneficiary under this Trust. The Trustee and the Beneficiaries’ Representative shall have the right to rely on the accuracy and completeness of any statement provided to it by Grantor’s Secretary, Assistant Secretary or Chief Executive Officer as to the Beneficiary status of any individual. 
3.3	Beneficiaries’ Representative. Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, all communications or demands made by and among the Trustee and the Beneficiaries are to be made through the individual then designated as the Beneficiaries’ Representative. The Beneficiaries’ Representative shall have the exclusive right to convey Demands from time to time on the Trustee to direct payment to one or more of the Beneficiaries. 
3.4	Identity of Beneficiaries’ Representative. 
3.4.1	The initial Beneficiaries’ Representative shall be the person identified as the Beneficiaries’ Representative in the first paragraph of this Agreement.
3.4.2	Any subsequent Beneficiaries’ Representative shall be a person who is a present or past nonemployee Director of Grantor, designated in writing to the Grantor from time to time by a majority of the current nonemployee Directors on the Board of Directors. For this purpose, a Director who has not been employed by Grantor during the current calendar year and the preceding three (3) years shall be regarded as a nonemployee Director. The Grantor and Beneficiaries shall be entitled to rely on the original appointment of that individual as the Beneficiaries’ Representative unless notified in writing of a change in the Beneficiaries’ Representative by a writing signed by the former Beneficiaries’ Representative. A Beneficiary shall be deemed to have consented to such change in Beneficiaries’ Representative if such Beneficiary is provided with notice of such change by the Grantor and does not provide written notice to the Grantor of objection to the change within ten (10) days. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such subsequent appointment as of the date such writing is received by the Trustee. In the absence of an effective appointment of a Beneficiaries’ Representative, the Grantor or any Beneficiary may, after ten (10) days’ written notice to all Beneficiaries and Grantor, petition a court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of the Trust for appointment of a Beneficiaries’ Representative who need not be a nonemployee Director (if none are willing or able to serve), but shall in no event be an Officer or Director elected or appointed after a Change of Control who was not a Beneficiary prior to such Change of Control. The designation or appointment of a successor Beneficiaries’ Representative shall become effective only upon the execution of a counterpart of this Agreement whereby the successor Beneficiaries’ Representative shall assume and become bound by all the duties and responsibilities of a Beneficiaries’ Representative under this Agreement.
3.4.3	The Grantor shall notify the Trustee of any new Beneficiaries’ Representative.  Until any such notification is received, the Trustee shall be entitled to treat the last identified Beneficiaries’ Representative as the Beneficiaries’ Representative for all purposes hereunder.  Upon the execution of a counterpart of this Agreement by such new Beneficiaries’ Representative the Trustee shall be entitled, without inquiry, to treat such new Beneficiaries’ Representative as the Beneficiaries’ Representative for all purposes hereunder.  Upon request, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely on the accuracy and completeness of: (1) a written list delivered to the Trustee by Grantor, and certified by the Secretary of Grantor to be accurate and to have been prepared in good faith, identifying the names and addresses of all then current Beneficiaries, (2) a written notice delivered to the Trustee by Grantor, and certified by the Secretary of Grantor to be accurate and to have been prepared in good faith, identifying the name and address of the then current Beneficiaries’ Representative.
3.5	Right of Beneficiaries to Receive Payments. Subject to court order to the contrary, the rights of the Beneficiaries to make a Demand and receive distributions from the Trustee shall not be affected or diminished in any way by the existence of any dispute between one or more Beneficiaries and Grantor or anyone acting on behalf of Grantor in a derivative or representative capacity, and the Trustee in making distributions from the Trust Fund shall be entitled to rely upon the simple Demand of a Beneficiary, as conveyed by the Beneficiaries’ Representative pursuant to Section 4.7. Such distributions shall be made notwithstanding any notice or demand by or on behalf of Grantor or anyone acting on behalf of Grantor in a derivative or representative capacity that the distributions should not be made, whether based on Grantor’s claim that any Beneficiary is not entitled to some or all of the amount of such distributions or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no responsibility or liability to Grantor for making any payment despite having received any such notice or demand by or on behalf of Grantor. The Trustee shall have no responsibility to inquire into the accuracy or truthfulness of any such notice or demand, whether from Grantor or the Beneficiaries’ Representative. 
ARTICLE 4 
THE TRUST FUND 
4.1	Trust Fund; Grantor Trust. The Trustee shall hold all property received by it as custodian in Trust hereunder as one fund in the Trust Account which, together with the income and gains therefrom and additions thereto, shall constitute the “Trust Fund.” The Trust is intended to be a grantor trust within the meaning of Section 671 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and shall be construed accordingly. The Trust Fund shall not be paid to Grantor or any trustee in bankruptcy of Grantor, shall be held separate and apart from other funds of Grantor, and shall be used exclusively for the purposes set forth herein.
4.2 Minimum Balance. The Trustee shall continue to hold the amount in the Trust Fund immediately prior to the date of execution of this Agreement as part of the Minimum Balance under this Agreement.  Grantor shall transfer as of the effective date of this Agreement an additional sum sufficient to cause the total balance held by the Trustee to equal $50,000,000 which thereafter shall be the “Minimum Balance,” to be held in trust, for the stated uses and purposes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall preclude Grantor from making additional transfers of funds from time to time to the Trustee, whether required under the terms of this Agreement or not, to be held in trust as part of the Trust Fund. If Grantor makes additional transfers of funds to the Trust Fund, such additional transfers shall be deemed an increase of the Minimum Balance and Exhibit A shall be automatically amended without further action by the parties to this Agreement. Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative shall periodically, but no less than every third anniversary of this Agreement, review the adequacy of the Minimum Balance. 
4.3 Maintenance of Minimum Balance. The Trustee agrees to provide monthly reports to Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative showing the current fair market value of the Trust Fund. If any such report shows that the current fair market value of the Trust Fund is less than the Minimum Balance, then within ten (10) days after such report, Grantor agrees to deliver cash funds to the Trustee equal to the difference between the fair market value of the Trust Fund and the Minimum Balance so that the Trust balance is at least equal to the Minimum Balance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Grantor shall have no obligation to make payments to the Trustee in excess of $400,000,000 (including the Minimum Balance at the Effective Date and the additional funds contributed following execution of this Agreement) under or with respect to this Agreement. 
4.4	Additional Contributions. Subject to the aggregate limitation of $400,000,000 set forth in Section 4.3, Grantor agrees to make additional contributions (“Additional Contributions”) to the Trust Fund within ten (10) days after receipt of a written request from the Beneficiaries’ Representative certifying in good faith that Claims have or are reasonably expected to be asserted against Beneficiaries and that estimated Losses and Expenses for all pending, threatened or anticipated Claims against all Beneficiaries are reasonably expected to exceed the then Trust Fund balance. A copy of the written certification shall be provided to the Trustee at the same time and in the same manner as it is provided to Grantor. The written certification shall be accompanied by an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that, based on the information made known to such counsel, (a) the Claims do not appear to be Excluded Claims and (b) the amount requested seems reasonable in the circumstances noted above. Independent counsel shall be selected by the Beneficiaries’ Representative and shall have no present or past professional relationship to the Beneficiaries who are the subject of the Claims.
4.5	Excess Balance. If at any time the fair market value of the Trust Fund shall exceed the Minimum Balance, plus any additional contributions which continue to be required pursuant to Section 4.4, Grantor shall be entitled to withdraw an amount equal to the excess over the said sum upon thirty (30) days’ advance written notice to the Beneficiaries’ Representative. 
4.6	Direction of Investment. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Grantor retains the right to direct the investment of the Trust Fund and the Trustee shall have no duty to review or recommend investments; provided, however, that Grantor shall only direct the Trustee to invest the Trust Fund in Eligible Securities in accordance with Grantor’s current cash-management policies. If Grantor instructs the Trustee to invest in securities other than in Cash, Government Securities, Municipal Securities, Corporate Securities, Money Market Funds or Treasury Securities, such instruction shall be accompanied by the written consent of the Beneficiaries’ Representative as to the investment(s) in such Other Eligible Securities. Unless otherwise instructed by Grantor in writing, the Trustee shall initially maintain the investments in the account or accounts transferred from the 2016 Trust, which amounts following transfer shall be subject to this Section 4.6. If for any reason one or more existing investments shall not be available going forward, and Grantor shall fail to direct the Trustee pursuant to written instructions as to how to invest the Trust Fund (including the consent of the Beneficiaries’ Representative if the proposed investment is in other than Eligible Securities), the Trustee shall invest the Trust Fund in accordance with the last instruction received. In the event the Trustee is required to make a distribution pursuant to Section 4.7 at a time when the Trust Fund has insufficient cash to cover such distribution, the Trustee shall promptly notify the Grantor. The Grantor shall then direct the Trustee as to which Trust investments to liquidate in order to cover the required distribution; if Grantor does not respond to the Trustee’s inquiry within two (2) Business Days the Trustee shall liquidate investments in the order specified in Exhibit B. The Trustee may purchase or sell to itself or any affiliate, as principal or agent, investments authorized by this Agreement. Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative acknowledge that regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency grant the right to receive brokerage confirmations of the security transactions as they occur, at no additional cost. To the extent permitted by law, Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative specifically waive compliance with 12 CFR 12 and hereby notify the Trustee that no brokerage confirmations need be sent relating to the security transactions as they occur. 
4.7	Distributions from Trust Fund.
4.7.1	Duties of Beneficiary. A Beneficiary making a demand for indemnity shall certify in each demand regarding a Claim for a Covered Act (a “Demand”) delivered to the Beneficiaries’ Representative that (a) he or she is entitled to payment of at least the amount demanded, (b) no part of the Demand is an Excluded Claim or is precluded by the Act or applicable successor statute, (c) the Beneficiary will repay to the Trust any amounts paid or applied to or for the use of such Beneficiary in the event of an Ultimate Determination that such payments are Excluded Claims or precluded by the Act, or in the event the Beneficiary receives payment for the same Claim from another source, and (d) a request, properly made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Articles or contract with respect to indemnification, to Grantor for indemnification or advancement of the amount demanded has remained unsatisfied for twenty (20) days and that no part of the amount then being demanded from the Trust Fund has previously been received from Grantor. The Demand shall also specify the amount of the demanded distribution and intended manner of receipt, along with an address and telephone number of the Beneficiary.
4.7.2	Duties of Beneficiaries’ Representative. The Beneficiaries’ Representative shall convey a Beneficiary’s Demand to the Trustee. Along with the conveyance of such Demand to the Trustee, the Beneficiaries’ Representative shall submit, in a writing signed by the Beneficiaries’ Representative, a statement (a) that the Demand is being made pursuant to the Articles and this Agreement, as each such may be amended or restated from time to time, provided that any such amendment shall be given effect under this Agreement only to the extent that the amendment provides broader indemnification rights than existed prior to such amendment, (b) that the Demand is for satisfaction of indemnification obligations of Grantor, (c) that the Demand is being made by a Beneficiary, (d) that specifies the amounts being demanded by the Beneficiary, and (e) that the Beneficiaries’ Representative is not aware of any facts or conditions that would make indemnification pursuant to this Agreement invalid, provided, however, that the Beneficiaries’ Representative has no duty to independently investigate the validity of a Demand.
4.7.3	Duties of Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver a copy of each Demand to Grantor as promptly as reasonably possible. A copy of the Beneficiaries’ Representative’s statement also shall be delivered to Grantor. As soon as practicable after any such Demand is conveyed by the Beneficiaries’ Representative, subject to the provisions of Section 3.5, the Trustee shall distribute funds to the Beneficiary specified in such Demand in the amount and manner set forth therein. If the Trustee does not have sufficient funds to satisfy all pending Demands of Beneficiaries in full, the Trustee shall make all reasonable efforts to make pro rata payments, less any amounts due the Trustee, to the Beneficiaries as specified by the Beneficiaries’ Representative. If and to the extent the Trust Fund is replenished, the Trustee shall continue to make pro rata distributions, less any amounts due the Trustee, until the Demand is satisfied or to satisfy subsequent Demands. 
4.8	Taxes. Grantor agrees to pay any and all taxes on the Trust Fund or the income thereof, which taxes the Beneficiaries or the Trustee otherwise would be required to pay with respect to the interest of any person or persons therein, and to provide the Trustee and the Beneficiaries’ Representative with proof of payment of such taxes. This does not include any taxes payable upon an indemnification payment distribution from the Trust if the same would be taxable to the recipient Beneficiary under applicable law. The Trustee shall comply with all tax withholding obligations with respect to any indemnification payment distribution from the Trust under all applicable laws. The Trustee shall properly maintain all books and records related to any tax withholdings required to be performed by the Trustee hereunder, and, upon Grantor’s request, shall promptly provide to Grantor copies and evidences of such tax withholdings and related books and records. Grantor shall provide the Trustee with tax withholding direction (in written instruction) in respect of each indemnification payment distribution from the Trust to a Beneficiary, and provide any additional information necessary to determine whether any tax withholding is required and any appropriate tax forms and documents (including, without limitation, IRS Forms W-9 or W-8) as the Trustee may reasonably request. 
4.9	Duties and Responsibilities of Beneficiaries’ Representative. The Beneficiaries’ Representative (and any successor Beneficiaries’ Representative) shall have the following affirmative duties and responsibilities: 
4.9.1	To demand deposits from Grantor so as to maintain the Minimum Balance of the Trust in accordance with Section 4.3 and any Additional Contributions required by Section 4.4; 
4.9.2	To demand payment by the Trustee to a Beneficiary who has made a Demand and who, in the good faith judgment of the Beneficiaries’ Representative, has satisfied the conditions for indemnification as set forth in this Agreement and the Articles, provided, however, that the Beneficiaries’ Representative has no duty to independently investigate the validity of a Demand; and 
4.9.3	To use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Grantor and the Trustee to discharge their respective responsibilities under this Agreement and the responsibilities of Grantor under the Articles, including the bringing of legal actions and proceedings to enforce such Agreement. 
4.10	Administrative Powers of Trustee. Subject to Grantor’s right pursuant to Section 4.6 to direct investment of the Trust Fund in Eligible Securities, the Trustee shall have the power to do any of the following: 
4.10.1	To cause any investment to be registered and held in the name of one or more of its nominees, or one or more nominees of any system for the central handling of securities, without increase or decrease of liability; 
4.10.2	To collect and receive any and all money and other property due to the Trust Fund and to give full discharge therefor; and 
4.10.3	To hold uninvested, without liability for interest thereon, such monies received by the Trustee as the Trustee considers necessary to meet anticipated and imminent disbursements. 
4.11	Adverse Determination. In the event the trust arrangement created hereby is deemed to be invalid or ineffective as a trust by a court of competent jurisdiction, whether in connection with the bankruptcy of one of the parties hereto or otherwise (an “Adverse Determination”), then the parties agree that the nature of their relationship shall be Grantor as debtor, the Trustee as securities intermediary and the Beneficiaries’ Representative as secured party for the benefit of the Beneficiaries. To that end, and to secure the obligation of Grantor to indemnify Beneficiaries, Grantor hereby grants the Beneficiaries’ Representative for the benefit of the Beneficiaries a continuing security interest in, and pledges all rights, title and interest in and to, the following (for purposes of this Section 4.11, the “Collateral”): 
4.11.1	The Trust Account and the Trust Fund, and any certificates or instruments representing or evidencing the Trust Fund, and all cash, investment property, interest, dividends, rights and other property at any time and from time to time received, receivable or otherwise issued, distributed or distributable in respect of or in exchange for any or all of the Trust Fund; 
4.11.2	All other investment property and other property hereafter issued, delivered or deliverable to Trustee in substitution for or in addition to any of the foregoing, all certificates and instruments representing or evidencing such other property and all cash, investment property, interest, dividends, rights and other property at any time and from time to time received, receivable or otherwise issued, distributed or distributable after the date hereof in respect of or in exchange for any or all thereof; and 
4.11.3	All proceeds of all of the foregoing. 
Grantor and, at the direction of the Beneficiaries’ Representative, the Trustee shall execute such other documents and instruments as the Beneficiaries’ Representative reasonably may require from time to time to perfect and protect the first priority security interest of the Beneficiaries’ Representative on behalf of the Beneficiaries in the Collateral but the Trustee shall have no duty to prepare or file any such documents or instruments. In the event of an Adverse Determination, the Beneficiaries’ Representative shall have and shall be deemed to have had all the rights and remedies of a secured party under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and may exercise any of the rights and remedies available to the Beneficiaries’ Representative under the UCC as in effect from time to time in the State of Washington or otherwise available to the Beneficiaries’ Representative, including, without limitation, sale, assignment or other disposal of the Collateral in exchange for cash or credit. Grantor agrees that a Demand is also a notice of disposition under Section 9-611 of the UCC and that five (5) Business Days is reasonable notice if notice of a disposition is required under Section 9-611 of the UCC. Furthermore, Grantor agrees that any Beneficiary may be the purchaser of the Collateral consisting of Cash, Corporate Securities, Government Securities or Municipal Securities at a private sale without notice because the Collateral is of a type sold on a recognized market or the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations. The Beneficiaries’ Representative shall provide the Trustee with an Adverse Determination notice as soon as practicable, although failure to provide such notice shall not affect the rights or obligations of the parties to this Trust, except that a Beneficiary shall not take any action with respect to the Trustee as securities intermediary until such notice is provided. Except for the amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to Section 7.3, the Trustee waives any right of set-off, banker’s lien or other lien or claim it may have to the Collateral.
Grantor covenants and agrees that it shall not pledge, assign, hypothecate or transfer its interest in the Trust Account or the Trust Fund. Grantor further covenants and agrees that it shall not so direct the Trustee, and the Trustee agrees that it will not acknowledge or agree to any such pledge, assignment, hypothecation or transfer. 
ARTICLE 5 
RESIGNATION, REMOVAL, OR DEATH OF TRUSTEE 
5.1	Resignation of Trustee. The Trustee may resign at any time by delivering its written resignation to Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative. Such resignation shall take effect sixty (60) days from the date of delivery or upon appointment of a successor pursuant to Section 5.3, whichever shall first occur. 
5.2	Removal of Trustee. Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative may remove the Trustee at any time by delivering to the Trustee a written notice of its removal and the appointment of a successor pursuant to Section 5.3. 
5.3	Appointment of Successor Trustee. 
5.3.1	Removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee shall take effect sixty (60) days following delivery to the Trustee of (a) an instrument in writing removing the Trustee and appointing such successor, executed by Grantor and accompanied by an instrument in writing signed by the Beneficiaries’ Representative certifying the Beneficiaries’ Representative’s agreement to such removal and appointment, and (b) an acceptance in writing, executed by such successor, both acknowledged in the same form as this Agreement. The Trustee may agree to an earlier effective date. In the event of the merger, sale (of all or substantially all of the Trustee’s corporate trust business) or dissolution of the Trustee, a successor trustee shall be appointed by Grantor (which successor trustee may be in Grantor’s sole discretion the acquiring party or successor entity in the case of sale or merger of the Trustee) with the approval of the Beneficiaries’ Representative, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and a writing to such effect and an acceptance in writing, as referred to above, shall be delivered to the Trustee. In order to qualify to serve as Trustee, any successor trustee must, at a minimum: (i) be authorized under state or federal law to exercise corporate trust powers, (ii) have a combined capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000, and (iii) be subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority.
5.3.2	All of the provisions set forth herein with respect to the Trustee shall relate to each successor with the same force and effect as if such successor had been originally named as the Trustee under this Trust. 
5.3.3	If a successor is not appointed within sixty (60) days after the Trustee gives notice of its resignation pursuant to Section 4.1, or within sixty (60) days after the Trustee’s merger, sale (of all or substantially all of the Trustee’s corporate trust business) or dissolution, the Trustee or the Beneficiaries’ Representative may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of the Trust for appointment of a successor. 
5.4	Transfer of Fund to Successor. Upon appointment of a successor trustee as set forth above, the Trustee shall transfer and deliver the Trust Fund to such successor with authority to retain only reasonable reserves pending settlement of its final account as provided in Section 7.4. 
ARTICLE 6 
DURATION, TERMINATION, AND AMENDMENT OF TRUST 
6.1	Term.
6.1.1	The term of this Trust shall be for a period extending from the Effective Date until June 30, 2035, unless extended or terminated according to the terms of this Trust. This Trust may be terminated by consent of a majority of the then serving Board of Directors and a majority of the Beneficiaries serving as Officers at the time; provided, however, no such termination shall be effective (a) following a Change of Control, or (b) so as to reduce indemnification otherwise available to a Beneficiary of this Trust, specifically including any Beneficiaries who are not at such time current Officers, for any Demand then existing and still pending or with respect to any later asserted Demand arising out of a Covered Act occurring before the effective date of such termination. Expiration or termination of this Trust shall operate prospectively only, so that all provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to any Demand asserted prior to the effective date of expiration or termination relating to a Covered Act that occurs prior to the effective date of expiration or termination. Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative shall notify the Trustee of termination of the Trust by, with respect to Grantor, an instrument in writing executed by Grantor together with a certified copy of the resolution of the Board of Directors authorizing such termination and, with respect to the Beneficiaries’ Representative, written evidence of the consent of a majority of the Beneficiaries serving as Officers at the time. Termination by consent of Grantor and a majority of the Beneficiaries shall be effective on the later to occur of (i) Grantor’s Board of Directors resolution and (ii) receipt by the Beneficiaries’ Representative of written consents from at least a majority of the Beneficiaries as provided in this Section 6.1.1. 
6.1.2	Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative (jointly or separately) as applicable shall provide the Trustee and the Beneficiaries and their successors in interest with written notice of expiration at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date. 
6.1.3	In the event of a proposed termination prior to the expiration of the term of this Trust, Beneficiaries may assert a Demand if, in such Beneficiaries’ good faith judgment, there is a reasonable likelihood that following such proposed termination, a Claim will be asserted arising out of a Covered Act that occurred before the effective date of such termination. If so made, such Demand(s) shall be treated as a then existing and still pending Demand hereunder.
6.2	Distribution Upon Termination. When this Trust expires or is terminated in accordance with Section 6.1, the Trustee shall distribute the Trust Fund to Grantor less any full and adequate provision or reserves for any distributions to be made pursuant to any outstanding Demands under Sections 4.7 and 6.1.3 and any deductions authorized or required by Section 7.3. 
6.3	Amendment of Trust Instrument. 
6.3.1	Except in the event of a Change of Control, this Trust may be amended by consent of a majority of the Board of Directors, a majority of the Beneficiaries serving as Executive Officers at the time and the Trustee, provided, however, no such amendment shall be effective (a) following a Change of Control, or (b) so as to reduce indemnification or advancement of expenses otherwise available to a Beneficiary of this Trust for any Claim then existing and still pending or with respect to any later asserted Claim arising out of a Covered Act occurring before the effective date of such amendment and provided further, that approval of the Trustee shall only be required if the proposed amendment affects in any way the Trustee’s rights or duties under this Agreement. If the Trust is amended without the consent of the Trustee as permitted above, Grantor shall deliver notice of amendment to the Trustee or its successor in interest thirty (30) days prior to the proposed effective date of the amendment by an instrument in writing executed by Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative, together with a certified copy of the resolution of Grantor’s Board of Directors authorizing such amendment. Grantor shall send a copy of such notice to each individual Beneficiary or his or her successors in interest. 
6.3.2	In the event of a proposed amendment of this Trust, a Beneficiary may assert a Demand if, in the Beneficiary’s good faith judgment, there is a reasonable likelihood that following such proposed amendment, a Claim will be asserted arising out of a Covered Act that occurred before the effective date of such amendment and that will be affected by such amendment. If so made, such Demand(s) shall be treated as a then existing and still pending Demand hereunder. 
ARTICLE 7 
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE TRUSTEE 
7.1	Duties of Trustee. The duties and liabilities of the Trustee shall at all times be limited to those expressly stated in this Agreement and no implied duties or covenants shall be read into this Agreement against the Trustee. The Trustee shall discharge its duties hereunder with the reasonable care of a professional bank custodian for hire providing similar services to those set forth in this Agreement. 
7.2	Indemnification of Trustee. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized hereby or within the rights or powers conferred upon it hereunder, or taken or omitted by it in accordance with advice of counsel (which counsel may be of the Trustee’s own choosing and which may be house counsel of the Trustee), and shall not be liable for any mistake of fact or error of judgment or for any acts or omissions of any kind unless caused by willful misconduct or gross negligence. Grantor agrees to indemnify the Trustee and its officers, directors, agents and employees and hold it and them harmless against any and all liabilities, losses, claims, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) and damages incurred by it hereunder, except for liabilities, losses, claims, expenses, and damages incurred by the Trustee resulting from its own willful misconduct or gross negligence. This Section 7.2 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the earlier removal or resignation of the Trustee. 
7.3	Expenses and Compensation. The Trustee shall pay from the Trust Fund, to the extent not paid by Grantor, the Trustee’s reasonable expenses of administration of the Trust, including reasonable compensation and expenses of counsel (including house counsel) and any agents engaged by the Trustee to assist it in such administration. Grantor shall pay the Trustee reasonable compensation for its services as Trustee hereunder and the Trustee shall have a lien on the Trust Fund for such compensation and expenses until paid. 
7.4	Accounts of Trustees. The Trustee shall keep full accounts of all of its receipts and disbursements. Its financial statements, books, and records with respect to the Trust Fund shall be open to inspection by Grantor or the Beneficiaries’ Representative or their representatives at all reasonable times during business hours of the Trustee and may be audited not more frequently than once in each fiscal year by an independent certified public accountant engaged by the Beneficiaries’ Representative. Within ninety (90) days after the close of each fiscal year, or any termination of the duties of the Trustee, the Trustee shall prepare, sign and submit in duplicate to Grantor an account of its acts and transactions as Trustee under this Trust. 
7.5	Rights of Trustee. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise to incur any liability, financial or otherwise, in the performance of any of its duties hereunder. The Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees appointed with due care, and shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent, attorney, custodian or nominee so appointed, provided, however, the Trustee shall be responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Trustee be liable for special, indirect, punitive or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. The Trustee shall not be liable for an error in judgment made in good faith by an officer or officers of the Trustee, unless the Trustee was grossly negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts. 
Whenever in the administration of the provisions of this Agreement the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering any action to be taken hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by the Beneficiaries’ Representative and an officer of Grantor and delivered to the Trustee, and such certificate, in the absence of gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Agreement upon the faith thereof. The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, entitlement order, approval or other paper or document.
7.6	Right to Vote Assets. (a) Whenever Eligible Securities in the Trust Account (including, but not limited to, warrants, options, conversions, subscriptions, takeovers, other forms of capital reorganizations, redemptions, tenders, options to tender or non mandatory puts or calls) confer optional rights on the Grantor or provide for discretionary action or alternative courses of action by the Grantor, the Grantor shall be responsible for making any decisions relating thereto and for instructing the Trustee to act. The Trustee shall notify the Grantor of rights or discretionary actions with respect to Eligible Securities as promptly as practicable under the circumstances, provided that the Trustee has actually received notice of such right or discretionary corporate action from the relevant depository, etc. Absent actual receipt of such notice, the Trustee shall have no liability for failing to so notify the Grantor. Absent the Trustee’s timely receipt of instructions, the Trustee shall not be liable for failure to take any action relating to or to exercise any rights conferred by such Eligible Securities. In order for the Trustee to act subject to this subsection, it must receive the Grantor’s Instructions (defined below) at the Trustee’s offices, by the deadline specified by the Trustee, in its sole discretion, from time to time. If the Trustee does not receive such written instructions prior to its specified deadlines, the Trustee shall not be liable for failure to take any action relating to or to exercise any rights conferred by such Eligible Securities. 
(b)	In order to facilitate access by Grantor or its designee to ballots or online systems to assist in the voting of proxies received for eligible positions of securities held in the Trust Fund (excluding bankruptcy matters), the Trustee will, at the written request of Grantor upon the execution of this Agreement, appoint a provider of proxy voting services to act as agent of Grantor to provide global proxy voting services to Grantor. Trustee shall have no obligation or liability in respect of such proxy voting services or the acts or omissions of the provider of such proxy voting services.
7.7	Electronic Means.  The Trustee shall have the right to accept and act upon instructions, including funds transfer instructions (“Instructions”) given pursuant to this Agreement and delivered using Electronic Means; provided, however, that the Grantor shall provide to the Trustee an incumbency certificate listing officers with the authority to provide such Instructions (“Authorized Officers”) and containing specimen signatures of such Authorized Officers, which incumbency certificate shall be amended by the Grantor whenever a person is to be added or deleted from the listing. If the Grantor or Beneficiaries’ Representative elects to give the Trustee Instructions using Electronic Means and the Trustee in its discretion elects to act upon such Instructions, the Trustee’s understanding of such Instructions shall be deemed controlling. The Grantor understands and agrees that the Trustee cannot determine the identity of the actual sender of such Instructions and that the Trustee shall conclusively presume that directions that purport to have been sent by an Authorized Officer listed on the incumbency certificate provided to the Trustee have been sent by such Authorized Officer. The Grantor shall be responsible for ensuring that only Authorized Officers transmit such Instructions to the Trustee and that the Grantor and all Authorized Officers are solely responsible to safeguard the use and confidentiality of applicable user and authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys upon receipt by the Grantor. The Trustee shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from the Trustee’s reliance upon and compliance with such Instructions notwithstanding such directions conflict or are inconsistent with a subsequent written instruction. The Grantor agrees: (i) to assume all risks arising out of the use of Electronic Means to submit Instructions to the Trustee, including without limitation the risk of the Trustee acting on unauthorized Instructions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties; (ii) that it is fully informed of the protections and risks associated with the various methods of transmitting Instructions to the Trustee and that there may be more secure methods of transmitting Instructions than the method(s) selected by the Grantor; (iii) that the security procedures (if any) to be followed in connection with its transmission of Instructions provide to it a commercially reasonable degree of protection in light of its particular needs and circumstances; and (iv) to notify the Trustee immediately upon learning of any compromise or unauthorized use of the security procedures. The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” “delivery,” and words of like import in or relating to this Agreement or any document to be signed in connection with this Agreement shall be deemed to include electronic signatures, deliveries or the keeping of records in electronic form (including any electronic signature complying with the New York Electronic Signatures and Records Act (N.Y. State Tech. §§ 301-309), as amended from time to time, or other applicable law) or by other transmission method, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, and the parties hereto consent to conduct the transactions contemplated hereunder by Electronic Means. 
7.8	OFAC Certification and Covenants.
(a) 	Throughout the term of this Agreement, the Grantor (i) will have in place and will implement commercially reasonable policies and procedures designed to prevent violations of Sanctions, including measures to accomplish effective and timely scanning of all relevant data with respect to its clients and with respect to incoming or outgoing assets or transactions relating to this Agreement; (ii) shall ensure that neither the Grantor, any of the Grantor’s affiliates, directors, officers, employees, nor any Beneficiary is an individual or entity that is, or is owned or controlled by an individual or entity that is: (A) the target of Sanctions; or (B) located, organized or resident in a country or territory that is, or whose government is, the target of Sanctions; and (iii) shall not, directly or indirectly, use the services and/or Accounts in any manner that would result in a violation by any party of Sanctions. 
(b) 	The Grantor will promptly provide to the Trustee such information as the Trustee reasonably requests in connection with the matters referenced in this Section 7.8, including information regarding the Beneficiaries, the Trust Fund, the assets in relation to which services are to be provided and the source thereof, and the identity of any individual or entity having or claiming an interest therein. The Trustee may decline to act or provide services, and take such other actions as it, in its reasonable discretion, deems necessary or advisable, in connection with the matters referenced in this Section 7.8. If the Trustee declines to act or provide services as provided in the preceding sentence, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law or official request, the Trustee will inform the Grantor as soon as reasonably practicable.
ARTICLE 8 
MISCELLANEOUS 
8.1	Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial.

Exhibit 10.8 
INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT
This Agreement is made this __ day of ____________, 20__, by and between Microsoft Corporation, a Washington corporation (the “Company”) and _______________ (“Indemnitee”), a director of the Company and Hugh F. Johnston (the “Beneficiaries’ Representative”), and is effective as of the date that Indemnitee first became a director and/or executive officer of the Company.
WHEREAS, there is a general awareness that competent and experienced persons are becoming more reluctant to serve as directors or executive officers of publicly-held corporations unless they are protected by comprehensive policies of insurance or indemnification, due to the increasing number of lawsuits against such corporations and their directors and officers, the attendant expense of defending against such lawsuits, and the exposure of such directors and officers to unreasonably high damages;
WHEREAS, present laws and interpretations are frequently too uncertain to provide such officers and directors with adequate, reliable knowledge of the legal risks to which they may be exposed as a result of serving the corporation;
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has concluded that its directors and executive officers should be provided with protection against such risks in order to insure that the most capable persons will be attracted to such positions; and, therefore, has determined to contractually obligate itself to indemnify in a reasonable manner its directors and executive officers and to assume for itself the liability for expenses and damages in connection with claims lodged against its directors and executive officers as a result of their service to the Company;
WHEREAS, applicable law empowers corporations to indemnify persons serving as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation or a person who serves at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, and further empowers a corporation to purchase and maintain insurance (on behalf of such persons) against liability which may be asserted against Indemnitee or incurred by Indemnitee in any such capacity, or arising out of Indemnitee’s status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify against such liability under the provisions of said laws;
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has concluded that, due to the high cost and other negative features of the coverage under presently available directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, at this time it would not be in the best interest of its shareholders for the Company to purchase and maintain such insurance in the amounts customarily held by similar corporations and that its shareholders’ interest would be better served by contracting to indemnify its executive officers and directors thereby reasonably self-insuring against such potential liabilities;
WHEREAS, the Company desires to have Indemnitee serve or continue to serve as a director or executive officer of the Company free from undue concern for damages by reason of Indemnitee being a director and/or executive officer of the Company or by reason of his or her decision or actions on its behalf, and Indemnitee is willing to serve, or to continue to serve, only if he or she is furnished the indemnity provided for hereinafter in one or more of such capacities; and
WHEREAS, the parties believe it appropriate to memorialize and reaffirm the Company’s indemnification obligations to Indemnitee and, in addition, to set forth the agreements contained herein.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises, conditions, representations, and warranties set forth herein, including the Indemnitee’s continued service to the Company, the Company and Indemnitee hereby agree as follows:

“Covered Act” means any act or omission (including without limitation any breach of duty, neglect, error, misstatement, misleading statement, or otherwise, or appearing as or preparing to be a witness) by Indemnitee, and any Claim against Indemnitee, by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the Company, or of any subsidiary or division, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise.
“D&O Insurance” means any directors’ and officers’ liability insurance issued to the Company the proceeds of which are available for, and are tendered to, the Indemnitee.

A final order by a court of competent jurisdiction from which there is no further right of appeal.

“Excluded Claim” means any payment for Losses or Expenses in connection with any Claim the payment of which is Ultimately Determined to be prohibited by the Washington Business Corporation Act, public policy, or other applicable law (including binding regulations and orders of, and undertakings or other commitments with, any governmental entity or agency) as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the corporation to provide prior to such amendment).
“Expenses” means any reasonable expenses incurred by Indemnitee as a result of a Claim or Claims made against him for Covered Acts including, without limitation, counsel fees and costs of investigative, judicial, or administrative proceedings and any appeals.

“Ultimate Determination” means the method of Determination set forth in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of the above definition of Determination as selected by the Company, except that a final order from which there is no further right of appeal in any action in which Indemnitee seeks indemnification shall constitute the Ultimate Determination of the Indemnitee’s right to indemnification from the Company. “Ultimately Determined” shall have a correlative meaning.
2.	Indemnification. The Company agrees to indemnify and defend Indemnitee and hold him or her harmless from and against any and all Losses and Expenses subject, in each case, to the further provisions of this Agreement.
3.	Excluded Coverage. The Company shall have no obligation to indemnify Indemnitee for and hold him or her harmless from any Loss or Expense which has been Ultimately Determined to constitute an Excluded Claim or to the extent that Indemnitee has received the proceeds of D&O Insurance or to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise been indemnified.
4.	Indemnification Procedures.
4.1	Notice. Promptly after receipt by Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of or the threat of commencement of any Claim, Indemnitee shall, if Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification with respect thereto from the Company under this Agreement, promptly notify the Company and the Beneficiaries’ Representative of the commencement thereof and shall keep the Company generally informed of, and consult with the Company with respect to, the status of any such Claim.
4.2	D&O Insurance Applicable. If, at the time of the receipt of such notice, the Company has D&O Insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such Claim to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies in favor of Indemnitee. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of Indemnitee, all Losses and Expenses payable as a result of such Claim in accordance with the terms of such policies.
4.3	Advances of Expenses. The Company agrees to pay the Expenses of any such Claim in advance of the final disposition thereof to the extent payment for such Expenses is not promptly received from D&O Insurance or any other source of indemnity. The Company, if appropriate, shall be entitled to assume the defense of any Claim, with counsel satisfactory to Indemnitee, upon the delivery to Indemnitee of written notice of its election to assume the defense. After delivery of such notice and so long as the Company continues such defense, the Company will not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any legal or other Expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such defense other than Expenses of investigation and any out-of-pocket personal expenses incurred in preparing for and participating in the Claim. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or her counsel in any such Claim but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after delivery of notice from the Company of its assumption of such defense shall be at the Indemnitee’s expense provided that if (i) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been previously authorized by the Company, (ii) Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense or (iii) the Company shall not, in fact, have employed counsel which has assumed and continues the defense of such action, the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the Company.
4.4	Payment of Expenses. All payments on account of the Company’s indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall be made within sixty (60) days of Indemnitee’s written request therefor unless an Ultimate Determination is made that the claims giving rise to Indemnitee’s request are Excluded Claims or otherwise not payable under this Agreement, provided that all payments on account of the Company’s obligations under Section 4.3 of this Agreement prior to the final disposition of any Claim shall be made within twenty (20) days of Indemnitee’s written request therefor and such obligation shall not be subject to any such Ultimate Determination but shall be subject to this Agreement.
4.5	Indemnitee’s Obligation to Reimburse. Indemnitee agrees that he will reimburse the Company or the Trust, respectively, for all Losses and Expenses paid by the Company, or any Trustee of a Trust created by the Company, in connection with any Claim against Indemnitee in the event and only to the extent that an Ultimate Determination shall have been made that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company for such Losses and Expenses because the claim is an Excluded Claim or because Indemnitee is otherwise not entitled to payment under this Agreement.
5.	Settlement. The Company shall have no obligation to indemnify Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any Claim effected without the Company’s prior written consent except to the extent it is Ultimately Determined that such settlement is reasonable and in good faith. The Company shall not settle any claim in any manner which would impose any Fine or any obligation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee’s written consent. Neither the Company nor Indemnitee shall unreasonably withhold their consent to any proposed settlement.
6.	Partial Indemnification. If Indemnitee is entitled under any provisions of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of Expenses and Losses but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion of such Expenses and Losses to which Indemnitee is entitled.
7.	Enforcement.
7.1	Burden of Proof. Indemnitee’s right to indemnification shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction and shall be enforceable notwithstanding any adverse Determination (pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) but not (iv) of the definition of Determination in Section 1). In any action in which Indemnitee seeks indemnification, the Company shall have the burden of proving that indemnification is not required under this Agreement. The termination of any Claim by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not of itself create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
7.2	Enforcement Expenses. In the event that any action is instituted in which Indemnitee or the Beneficiaries’ Representative seeks indemnification of Indemnitee under this Agreement, or to enforce or interpret any of the terms of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, incurred by Indemnitee with respect to such action, unless the court determines that such action was not brought in good faith or was frivolous.
8.	Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court to require the Company to do or to fail to do an act which is in violation of applicable law, such provision shall be limited or modified in its application to the minimum extent necessary to avoid a violation of law, and, as so limited or modified, such provision and the balance of this Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with their terms.
9.	Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington.
10.	Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be (i) binding upon all successors and assigns of the company (including any transferee of all or substantially all of its assets and any successor by merger or otherwise by operation of law) and of the Beneficiaries’ Representative and (ii) shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the spouses, heirs, personal representatives, and estate of Indemnitee. The Company shall not effect any sale of substantially all of its assets, merger, consolidation, or other reorganization unless the surviving entity agrees in writing to assume all the obligations of the Company under this Agreement and to indemnify Indemnitee and advance Expenses in accordance with this Agreement.
11.	Amendment. No amendment, modification, termination, or cancellation of this Agreement shall be effective unless made in a writing signed by each of the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.
12.	Deposit in Trust. The Company has created a Trust (the "Trust”) for the benefit of the Indemnitee and others (collectively, including Indemnitee, the “Beneficiaries”) in the form of Exhibit A (the “Trust Agreement”). Indemnitee is specifically acknowledged as a third party beneficiary of the Trust Agreement, and therefore, in addition to Indemnitee’s rights under this Agreement and any applicable insurance policy, Indemnitee shall also have the right to receive indemnification from the Trust in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and of the Trust Agreement. The Company agrees to fund and maintain the Trust Fund in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article II of the Trust Agreement and to discharge all its other obligations pursuant to the Trust Agreement.
13.	Procedure for Making Demand. Indemnitee shall first make demand upon the Company in accordance with the Indemnification Procedures of Section 4 to honor its indemnity obligation under this Agreement. If the Company shall fail to indemnify on a timely basis, the Beneficiary shall deliver a certificate to the Beneficiaries’ Representative setting forth the information required pursuant to section 4.7.1 of the Trust Agreement. Indemnitee shall not be required to institute a lawsuit or take other actions against the Company or any insurer to recover the unpaid amount prior to the Beneficiaries’ Representative making a demand and receiving payment from the Trustee on his or her behalf.
14.	Duties and Responsibilities of Beneficiaries’ Representative. The Beneficiaries’ Representative (and any successor Beneficiaries’ Representative) shall have the following affirmative duties and responsibilities:
14.1	To demand deposits from the Company so as to maintain the Minimum Balance and make any Additional Contribution as required by sections 4.3 and 4.4 of the Trust Agreement;
14.2	To demand payments by the Trustee to Indemnitee, upon demand by Indemnitee where, in the good faith judgment of the Beneficiaries’ Representative, the Indemnitee has satisfied the conditions for indemnification as set forth in this Agreement and the Trust Agreement;
14.3	To generally cause the Company and Trustee to discharge their respective responsibilities under this Agreement and the Trust Agreement, including the bringing of legal actions and proceedings to enforce such Agreement.
15.	Other Indemnity. The provisions in this Agreement are intended to be nonexclusive of indemnity under the Company’s articles of incorporation, bylaws, other agreements, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. All applicable indemnity shall be interpreted and applied so as to provide Indemnitee with the broadest but nonduplicative indemnity to which he or she is entitled. 
16.	Communications. All notices, consents, or other communications required or contemplated by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered either by (a) personal delivery, (b) overnight courier, or (c) postage prepaid return receipt requested certified mail to the last address given to the Trustee by each respective Beneficiary. Notice by personal delivery shall be effective upon the date service is made, and notice by certified mail or overnight courier shall be effective on the date it is recorded as delivered by the U.S. Postal Service or the overnight courier, respectively.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.
Exhibit A
AMENDED AND RESTATED
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNIFICATION TRUST AGREEMENT
             This AMENDED AND RESTATED DIRECTORS’ INDEMNIFICATION TRUST AGREEMENT (this “Trust” or this “Agreement”) between MICROSOFT CORPORATION, a Washington corporation (“Grantor”), and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. the “Trustee”), whose address is 601 Travis Street, Houston, Texas 77002 and, as an additional party, Hugh F. Johnston (the “Beneficiaries’ Representative”) shall be effective as of June 30, 2025 (the “Effective Date”).
RECITALS
Grantor initially established the directors’ indemnification trust by an agreement dated as of June 30, 2003 (the “Original Trust Agreement”) to be a source of indemnification for Grantor’s Directors who are eligible for such indemnification as stated in this Trust as it is in effect from time to time.
Grantor and Beneficiaries of this Trust adopted an amendment to the Original Agreement in November 2006, and further amended and restated the Trust in July of 2010 and June 30 of 2016 (the “Amended and Restated Indemnification Trust Agreement”).  Pursuant to an Assumption of Beneficiaries’ Representative Obligations Under Amended and Restated Directors’ Indemnification Trust Agreement, date as of December 4, 2019, Hugh F. Johnston agreed to serve as the successor Beneficiaries’ Representative under the Amended and Restated Indemnification Trust Agreement.
Grantor has determined, after due diligence, that it has and will continue to derive substantial economic benefits from this Trust, including from economic terms that are more favorable to Grantor than obtaining protection for its Directors through the current director and officer insurance market.
Grantor’s Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles”) provide for mandatory indemnification of Grantor’s Directors to the maximum extent provided by law, and as such, this Trust is not an exclusive source of indemnification for such Directors.
Grantor has determined that continuation and further amendment of this Trust is necessary in order for Grantor to attract and retain the most qualified persons to serve as Directors.
Grantor and the Beneficiaries under the Amended and Restated Indemnification Trust Agreement wish to amend certain provisions in that trust agreement and to restate in its entirety the Amended and Restated Indemnification Trust Agreement and replace it with this amended and restated Agreement. Grantor’s Board of Directors has acted by resolution adopted June 11, 2025 to amend and restate the Amended and Restated Indemnification Trust Agreement effective as of the Effective Date. 
Except as otherwise noted, the capitalized terms have the meaning ascribed to them in the body of this Agreement.
AGREEMENT
	NOW, THEREFORE, as of the Effective Date, Grantor and the Trustee acknowledge that the funds held under the Amended and Restated Indemnification Trust Agreement shall be held in trust under this Agreement and the Trustee accepts the trust created hereby and agrees that it will hold all property which it may receive or hold hereunder specifically including the Minimum Balance as defined in Section 4.2 at the Effective Date, together with the additional funds, as custodian IN TRUST, for the purposes and upon the terms and conditions hereinafter stated, and Grantor, the Trustee and the Beneficiaries’ Representative agree as follows:

        PRIOR COVERED ACTS AND CLAIMS 
2.2	Indemnification for Covered Acts. The Beneficiaries under this Trust shall be indemnified for any Losses, Expenses or Fines that result from a Claim based on a Covered Act asserted while this Trust is in effect without regard to whether the Covered Act occurred on, before or after the establishment of this Trust. Rights to coverage as a Beneficiary under this Agreement shall be deemed to vest with and upon such person’s election as a Director. If a Beneficiary of this Trust was also a “Beneficiary” of the Original Trust and/or the Amended and Restated Indemnification Trust Agreement because such person was or is a Director prior to the Effective Date, such person shall be covered by this Trust as a Beneficiary under this Trust as well for “Covered Acts” as defined herein that occurred prior to the Effective Date.
2.3	Nonexclusive Remedy. The rights of Beneficiaries to indemnification from this Trust are limited to the assets of the Trust, but this does not limit any Beneficiary’s rights, if any, to indemnification (without duplication) from Grantor, or other Grantor arrangements or obligations, including but not limited to any applicable insurance coverage.
ARTICLE 3 
THE BENEFICIARIES AND THE BENEFICIARIES’ REPRESENTATIVE 
3.1	The Beneficiaries. All present and future Directors and all “Beneficiaries” of the Original Trust Agreement and/or the Amended and Restated Indemnification Trust Agreement who were “Beneficiaries” of such trusts as Directors shall be “Beneficiaries” of this Trust (and each a “Beneficiary”), provided, however, that if there is a Change of Control of Grantor, no directors elected or appointed after or in connection with such Change of Control shall be entitled to be Beneficiaries who were not Beneficiaries prior to such Change of Control. For purposes of this Agreement, “Change of Control” shall mean (a) a tender offer or exchange offer in which the purpose of such offer is to take over and control Grantor and such offer is accepted by owners of securities of Grantor representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of Grantor’s then outstanding voting securities, (b) Grantor is merged or consolidated with another corporation and as a result of such merger or consolidation less than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving or resulting corporation shall then be owned in the aggregate by the former shareholders of Grantor, (c) Grantor transfers substantially all of its assets to another corporation which is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of Grantor, or (d) during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, individuals who at the beginning of such twelve (12) month period were directors of Grantor cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of Grantor’s Board of Directors. The Beneficiaries’ Representative shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of a Change of Control. Any Beneficiary shall remain a Beneficiary despite his or her resignation, removal, or other failure to continue to be a member of Grantor’s Board of Directors during the term of this Agreement. A person whose conduct gives rise to a right of indemnification both as a member of the Board of Directors and as an Officer of Grantor, shall be a Beneficiary hereunder as to all such conduct without being required to separate his or her activities between the role of Director and the role of Officer.
3.2	New Beneficiaries. If prior to a Change of Control an individual is duly elected to the Board of Directors, Grantor agrees to notify the Trustee and the Beneficiaries’ Representative promptly of such election or appointment; provided, however, Grantor’s failure to so notify the Trustee and the Beneficiaries’ Representative shall not affect in any way an individual Director’s rights as a Beneficiary under this Trust. The Trustee and the Beneficiaries’ Representative shall have the right to rely on the accuracy and completeness of any statement provided to it by Grantor’s Secretary, Assistant Secretary or Chief Executive Officer as to the Beneficiary status of any individual.
3.3	Beneficiaries’ Representative. Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, all communications or demands made by and among the Trustee and the Beneficiaries are to be made through the individual then designated as the Beneficiaries’ Representative. The Beneficiaries’ Representative shall have the exclusive right to convey Demands from time to time on the Trustee to direct payment to one or more of the Beneficiaries.
3.4	Identity of Beneficiaries’ Representative. 
3.4.1 The initial Beneficiaries’ Representative shall be the person identified as the Beneficiaries’ Representative in the first paragraph of this Agreement.
3.4.2 Any subsequent Beneficiaries’ Representative shall be a Beneficiary who is a present or past nonemployee Director of Grantor, designated in writing to the Grantor from time to time by a majority of the current nonemployee Directors who are Beneficiaries under this Agreement.  For this purpose, a Director who has not been employed by Grantor during the current calendar year and the preceding three (3) years shall be regarded as a nonemployee Director.  The Grantor and Beneficiaries shall be entitled to rely on the original appointment of that individual as the Beneficiaries’ Representative unless notified in writing  of a  change  in the Beneficiaries’ Representative by a writing signed by the  former Beneficiaries’ Representative.  A Beneficiary shall be deemed to have consented to such change in Beneficiaries’ Representative if such Beneficiary is provided with notice of such change by the Grantor and does not provide written notice to the Grantor of objection to the change within ten (10) days.  The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such subsequent appointment as of the date such writing is received by the Trustee.  In the absence of an effective appointment of a Beneficiaries’ Representative, the Grantor or any Beneficiary may,  after ten (10) days’ written notice to all Beneficiaries and Grantor, petition a court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of the Trust for appointment of a Beneficiaries’ Representative who need not be a Beneficiary (if none are willing or able to serve), but shall in no event be an Officer or Director elected or appointed after a Change of Control who was not a Beneficiary prior to such Change of Control.  The designation or appointment of a successor Beneficiaries’ Representative shall become effective only upon the execution of a counterpart of this Agreement whereby the successor Beneficiaries’ Representative shall assume and become bound by all the  duties and responsibilities of a Beneficiaries’ Representative under this Agreement.
3.4.3 The Grantor shall notify the Trustee of any new Beneficiaries’ Representative.  Until any such notification is received, the Trustee shall be entitled to treat the last identified Beneficiaries’ Representative as the Beneficiaries’ Representative for all purposes hereunder.  Upon the execution of a counterpart of this Agreement by such new Beneficiaries’ Representative the Trustee shall be entitled, without inquiry, to treat such new Beneficiaries’ Representative as the Beneficiaries’ Representative for all purposes hereunder.  Upon request, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely on the accuracy and completeness of: (1) a written list delivered to the Trustee by Grantor, and certified by the Secretary of Grantor to be accurate and to have been prepared in good faith, identifying the names and addresses of all then current Beneficiaries, (2) a written notice delivered to the Trustee by Grantor, and certified by the Secretary of Grantor to be accurate and to have been prepared in good faith, identifying the name and address of the then current Beneficiaries’ Representative.
3.5	Right of Beneficiaries to Receive Payments. Subject to court order to the contrary, the rights of the Beneficiaries to make a Demand and receive distributions from the Trustee shall not be affected or diminished in any way by the existence of any dispute between one or more Beneficiaries and Grantor or anyone acting on behalf of Grantor in a derivative or representative capacity, and the Trustee in making distributions from the Trust Fund shall be entitled to rely upon the simple Demand of a Beneficiary, as conveyed by the Beneficiaries’ Representative pursuant to Section 4.7. Such distributions shall be made notwithstanding any notice or demand by or on behalf of Grantor or anyone acting on behalf of Grantor in a derivative or representative capacity that the distributions should not be made, whether based on Grantor’s claim that any Beneficiary is not entitled to some or all of the amount of such distributions or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no responsibility or liability to Grantor for making any payment despite having received any such notice or demand by or on behalf of Grantor. The Trustee shall have no responsibility to inquire into the accuracy or truthfulness of any such notice or demand, whether from Grantor or the Beneficiaries’ Representative.
ARTICLE 4 
       THE TRUST FUND 
4.1	Trust Fund; Grantor Trust. The Trustee shall hold all property received by it as custodian in Trust hereunder as one fund in the Trust Account which, together with the income and gains therefrom and additions thereto, shall constitute the “Trust Fund.” The Trust is intended to be a grantor trust within the meaning of Section 671 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and shall be construed accordingly. The Trust Fund shall not be paid to Grantor or any trustee in bankruptcy of Grantor, shall be held separate and apart from other funds of Grantor and shall be used exclusively for the purposes set forth herein.
4.2	 Minimum Balance. The Trustee shall continue to hold the amount in the Trust Fund immediately prior to the date of execution of this Agreement as part of the Minimum Balance under this Agreement. Grantor shall transfer as of the effective date of this Agreement an additional sum sufficient to cause the total balance held by the Trustee to equal $50,000,000 which thereafter shall be the “Minimum Balance,” to be held in trust, for the stated uses and purposes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall preclude Grantor from making additional transfers of funds from time to time to the Trustee, whether required under the terms of this Agreement or not, to be held in trust as part of the Trust Fund. If Grantor makes additional transfers of funds to the Trust Fund, such additional transfers shall be deemed an increase of the Minimum Balance and Exhibit A shall be automatically amended without further action by the parties to this Agreement. Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative shall periodically, but no less than every third anniversary of this Agreement, review the adequacy of the Minimum Balance. 
4.3	 Maintenance of Minimum Balance. The Trustee agrees to provide monthly reports to Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative showing the current fair market value of the Trust Fund. If any such report shows that the current fair market value of the Trust Fund is less than the Minimum Balance, then within ten (10) days after such report, Grantor agrees to deliver cash funds to the Trustee equal to the difference between the fair market value of the Trust Fund and the Minimum Balance so that the Trust balance is at least equal to the Minimum Balance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Grantor shall have no obligation to make payments to the Trustee in excess of $400,000,000 (including the Minimum Balance at the Effective Date and the additional funds contributed following execution of this Agreement) under or with respect to this Agreement. 
4.4	Additional Contributions. Subject to the aggregate limitation of $400,000,000 set forth in Section 4.3, Grantor agrees to make additional contributions (“Additional Contributions”) to the Trust Fund within ten (10) days after receipt of a written request from the Beneficiaries’ Representative certifying in good faith that Claims have or are reasonably expected to be asserted against Beneficiaries and that estimated Losses and Expenses for all pending, threatened or anticipated Claims against all Beneficiaries are reasonably expected to exceed the then Trust Fund balance. A copy of the written certification shall be provided to the Trustee at the same time and in the same manner as it is provided to Grantor. The written certification shall be accompanied by an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that, based on the information made known to such counsel, (a) the Claims do not appear to be Excluded Claims and (b) the amount requested seems reasonable in the circumstances noted above. Independent counsel shall be selected by the Beneficiaries’ Representative and shall have no present or past professional relationship to the Beneficiaries who are the subject of the Claims.
4.5	Excess Balance. If at any time the fair market value of the Trust Fund shall exceed the Minimum Balance, plus any additional contributions which continue to be required pursuant to Section 4.4, Grantor shall be entitled to withdraw an amount equal to the excess over the said sum upon thirty (30) days’ advance written notice to the Beneficiaries’ Representative. 
4.6	Direction of Investment. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Grantor retains the right to direct the investment of the Trust Fund and the Trustee shall have no duty to review or recommend investments; provided, however, that Grantor shall only direct the Trustee to invest the Trust Fund in Eligible Securities in accordance with Grantor’s current cash-management policies. If Grantor instructs the Trustee to invest in securities other than in Cash, Government Securities, Municipal Securities, Corporate Securities, Money Market Funds or Treasury Securities, such instruction shall be accompanied by the written consent of the Beneficiaries’ Representative as to the investment(s) in such Other Eligible Securities. If for any reason Grantor shall fail to direct the Trustee pursuant to written instructions as to how to invest the Trust Fund (including the consent of the Beneficiaries’ Representative if the proposed investment is in other than Eligible Securities), the Trustee shall invest the Trust Fund in accordance with the last instruction received. In the event the Trustee is required to make a distribution pursuant to Section 4.7 at a time when the Trust Fund has insufficient cash to cover such distribution, the Trustee shall promptly notify the Grantor. The Grantor shall then direct the Trustee as to which Trust investments to liquidate in order to cover the required distribution; if Grantor does not respond to the Trustee’s inquiry within two (2) Business Days the Trustee shall liquidate investments in the order specified in Exhibit B. The Trustee may purchase or sell to itself or any affiliate, as principal or agent, investments authorized by this Agreement. Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative acknowledge that regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency grant the right to receive brokerage confirmations of the security transactions as they occur, at no additional cost. To the extent permitted by law, Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative specifically waive compliance with 12 CFR 12 and hereby notify the Trustee that no brokerage confirmations need be sent relating to the security transactions as they occur. 
4.7	Distributions from Trust Fund.
4.7.1	Duties of Beneficiary. A Beneficiary making a demand for indemnity shall certify in each demand regarding a Claim for a Covered Act (a “Demand”) delivered to the Beneficiaries’ Representative that (a) he or she is entitled to payment of at least the amount demanded, (b) no part of the Demand is an Excluded Claim or is precluded by the Act or applicable successor statute, (c) the Beneficiary will repay to the Trust any amounts paid or applied to or for the use of such Beneficiary in the event of an Ultimate Determination that such payments are Excluded Claims or precluded by the Act, or in the event the Beneficiary receives payment for the same Claim from another source, and (d) a request, properly made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Articles or contract with respect to indemnification, to Grantor for indemnification or advancement of the amount demanded has remained unsatisfied for twenty (20) days and that no part of the amount then being demanded from the Trust Fund has previously been received from Grantor. The Demand shall also specify the amount of the demanded distribution and intended manner of receipt, along with an address and telephone number of the Beneficiary.
4.7.2	Duties of Beneficiaries’ Representative. The Beneficiaries’ Representative shall convey a Beneficiary’s Demand to the Trustee. Along with the conveyance of such Demand to the Trustee, the Beneficiaries’ Representative shall submit, in a writing signed by the Beneficiaries’ Representative, a statement (a) that the Demand is being made pursuant to the Articles and this Agreement, as each such may be amended or restated from time to time, provided that any such amendment shall be given effect under this Agreement only to the extent that the amendment provides broader indemnification rights than existed prior to such amendment, (b) that the Demand is for satisfaction of indemnification obligations of Grantor, (c) that the Demand is being made by a Beneficiary, (d) that specifies the amounts being demanded by the Beneficiary, and (e) that the Beneficiaries’ Representative is not aware of any facts or conditions that would make indemnification pursuant to this Agreement invalid, provided, however, that the Beneficiaries’ Representative has no duty to independently investigate the validity of a Demand.
4.7.3	Duties of Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver a copy of each Demand to Grantor as promptly as reasonably possible. A copy of the Beneficiaries’ Representative’s statement also shall be delivered to Grantor. As soon as practicable after any such Demand is conveyed by the Beneficiaries’ Representative, subject to the provisions of Section 3.5, the Trustee shall distribute funds to the Beneficiary specified in such Demand in the amount and manner set forth therein. If the Trustee does not have sufficient funds to satisfy all pending Demands of Beneficiaries in full, the Trustee shall make all reasonable efforts to make pro rata payments, less any amounts due the Trustee, to the Beneficiaries as specified by the Beneficiaries’ Representative. If and to the extent the Trust Fund is replenished, the Trustee shall continue to make pro rata distributions, less any amounts due the Trustee, until the Demand is satisfied or to satisfy subsequent Demands. 
4.8	Taxes. Grantor agrees to pay any and all taxes on the Trust Fund or the income thereof, which taxes the Beneficiaries or the Trustee otherwise would be required to pay with respect to the interest of any person or persons therein, and to provide the Trustee and the Beneficiaries’ Representative with proof of payment of such taxes. This does not include any taxes payable upon an indemnification payment distribution from the Trust if the same would be taxable to the recipient Beneficiary under applicable law. The Trustee shall comply with all tax withholding obligations with respect to any indemnification payment distribution from the Trust under all applicable laws. The Trustee shall properly maintain all books and records related to any tax withholdings required to be performed by the Trustee hereunder, and, upon Grantor’s request, shall promptly provide to Grantor copies and evidences of such tax withholdings and related books and records. Grantor shall provide the Trustee with tax withholding direction (in written instruction) in respect of each indemnification payment distribution from the Trust to a Beneficiary, and provide any additional information necessary to determine whether any tax withholding is required and any appropriate tax forms and documents (including, without limitation, IRS Forms W-9 or W-8) as the Trustee may reasonably request. 
4.9	Duties and Responsibilities of Beneficiaries’ Representative. The Beneficiaries’ Representative (and any successor Beneficiaries’ Representative) shall have the following affirmative duties and responsibilities: 
4.9.1	To demand deposits from Grantor so as to maintain the Minimum Balance of the Trust in accordance with Section 4.3 and any Additional Contributions required by Section 4.4; 
4.9.2	To demand payment by the Trustee to a Beneficiary who has made a Demand and who, in the good faith. judgment of the Beneficiaries’ Representative, has satisfied the conditions for indemnification as set forth in this Agreement and the Articles, provided, however, that the Beneficiaries’ Representative has no duty to independently investigate the validity of a Demand; and 
4.9.3	To use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Grantor and the Trustee to discharge their respective responsibilities under this Agreement and the responsibilities of Grantor under the Articles, including the bringing of legal actions and proceedings to enforce such Agreement. 
4.10	[Reserved]. 
4.11	Administrative Powers of Trustee. Subject to Grantor’s right pursuant to Section
4.6 to direct investment of the Trust Fund in Eligible Securities, the Trustee shall have the power to do any of the following:
4.11.1	To cause any investment to be registered and held in the name of one or more of its nominees, or one or more nominees of any system for the central handling of securities, without increase or decrease of liability; 
4.11.2	To collect and receive any and all money and other property due to the Trust Fund and to give full discharge therefor; and 
4.11.3	To hold uninvested, without liability for interest thereon, such monies received by the Trustee as the Trustee considers necessary to meet anticipated and imminent disbursements. 
4.12	Adverse Determination. In the event the trust arrangement created hereby is deemed to be invalid or ineffective as a trust by a court of competent jurisdiction, whether in connection with the bankruptcy of one of the parties hereto or otherwise (an “Adverse Determination”), then the parties agree that the nature of their relationship shall be Grantor as debtor, the Trustee as securities intermediary and the Beneficiaries’ Representative as secured party for the benefit of the Beneficiaries. To that end, and to secure the obligation of Grantor to indemnify Beneficiaries, Grantor hereby grants the Beneficiaries’ Representative for the benefit of the Beneficiaries a continuing security interest in, and pledges all rights, title and interest in and to, the following (for purposes of this Section 4.12, the “Collateral”):
4.12.1	The Trust Account and the Trust Fund, and any certificates or instruments representing or evidencing the Trust Fund, and all cash, investment property, interest, dividends, rights and other property at any time and from time to time received, receivable or otherwise issued, distributed or distributable in respect of or in exchange for any or all of the Trust Fund;
4.12.2	All other investment property and other property hereafter issued, delivered or deliverable to Trustee in substitution for or in addition to any of the foregoing, all certificates and instruments representing or evidencing such other property and all cash, investment property, interest, dividends, rights and other property at any time and from time to time received, receivable or otherwise issued, distributed or distributable after the date hereof in respect of or in exchange for any or all thereof; and
4.12.3	All proceeds of all of the foregoing
Grantor and, at the direction of the Beneficiaries’ Representative, the Trustee shall execute such other documents and instruments as the Beneficiaries’ Representative reasonably may require from time to time to perfect and protect the first priority security interest of the Beneficiaries’ Representative on behalf of the Beneficiaries in the Collateral but the Trustee shall have no duty to prepare or file any such documents or instruments. In the event of an Adverse Determination, the Beneficiaries’ Representative shall have and shall be deemed to have had all the rights and remedies of a secured party under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and may exercise any of the rights and remedies available to the Beneficiaries’ Representative under the UCC as in effect from time to time in the State of Washington or otherwise available to the Beneficiaries’ Representative, including, without limitation, sale, assignment or other disposal of the Collateral in exchange for cash or credit. Grantor agrees that a Demand is also a notice of disposition under Section 9-611 of the UCC and that five (5) Business Days is reasonable notice if notice of a disposition is required under Section 9-611 of the UCC. Furthermore, Grantor agrees that any Beneficiary may be the purchaser of the Collateral consisting of Cash, Corporate Securities, Government Securities or Municipal Securities at a private sale without notice because the Collateral is of a type sold on a recognized market or the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations. The Beneficiaries’ Representative shall provide the Trustee with an Adverse Determination notice as soon as practicable, although failure to provide such notice shall not affect the rights or obligations of the parties to this Trust, except that a Beneficiary shall not take any action with respect to the Trustee as securities intermediary until such notice is provided. Except for the amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to Section 7.3, the Trustee waives any right of set-off, banker’s lien or other lien or claim it may have to the Collateral.
Grantor covenants and agrees that it shall not pledge, assign, hypothecate or transfer its interest in the Trust Account or the Trust Fund. Grantor further covenants and agrees that it shall not so direct the Trustee, and the Trustee agrees that it will not acknowledge or agree to any such pledge, assignment, hypothecation or transfer. 
ARTICLE 5 
RESIGNATION, REMOVAL, OR DEATH OF TRUSTEE 
5.1	Resignation of Trustee. The Trustee may resign at any time by delivering its written resignation to Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative. Such resignation shall take effect sixty (60) days from the date of delivery or upon appointment of a successor pursuant to Section 5.3, whichever shall first occur. 
5.2	Removal of Trustee. Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative may remove the Trustee at any time by delivering to the Trustee a written notice of its removal and the appointment of a successor pursuant to Section 5.3. 
5.3	Appointment of Successor Trustee.

The Trustee may agree to an earlier effective date. In the event of the merger, sale (of all or substantially all of the Trustee’s corporate trust business) or dissolution of the Trustee, a successor trustee shall be appointed by Grantor (which successor trustee may be in Grantor’s sole discretion the acquiring party or successor entity in the case of sale or merger of the Trustee) with the approval of the Beneficiaries’ Representative, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and a writing to such effect and an acceptance in writing, as referred to above, shall be delivered to the Trustee. In order to qualify to serve as Trustee, any successor trustee must, at a minimum: (i) be authorized under state or federal law to exercise corporate trust powers, (ii) have a combined capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000, and (iii) be subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority.
5.3.2	All of the provisions set forth herein with respect to the Trustee shall relate to each successor with the same force and effect as if such successor had been originally named as the Trustee under this Trust. 
5.3.3	If a successor is not appointed within sixty (60) days after the Trustee gives notice of its resignation pursuant to Section 4.1, or within sixty (60) days after the Trustee’s merger, sale (of all or substantially all of the Trustee’s corporate trust business) or dissolution, the Trustee or the Beneficiaries’ Representative may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of the Trust for appointment of a successor. 
5.4	Transfer of Fund to Successor. Upon appointment of a successor trustee as set forth above, the Trustee shall transfer and deliver the Trust Fund to such successor with authority to retain only reasonable reserves pending settlement of its final account as provided in Section 7.4.

6.1	Term.
6.1.1	The term of this Trust shall be for a period extending from the effective date of the Original Trust Agreement until June 30, 2035, unless extended or terminated according to the terms of this Trust. This Trust may be terminated by consent of a majority of the Board of Directors and a majority of the then living Beneficiaries; provided, however, no such termination shall be effective (a) following a Change of Control, or (b) so as to reduce indemnification otherwise available to a Beneficiary of this Trust for any Demand then existing and still pending or with respect to any later asserted Demand arising out of a Covered Act occurring before the effective date of such termination. Expiration or termination of this Trust shall operate prospectively only, so that all provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to any Demand asserted prior to the effective date of expiration or termination relating to a Covered Act that occurs prior to the effective date of expiration or termination. Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative shall notify the Trustee of termination of the Trust by, with respect to Grantor, an instrument in writing executed by Grantor together with a certified copy of the resolution of the Board of Directors authorizing such termination and, with respect to the Beneficiaries’ Representative, written evidence of the consent of a majority of the then living Beneficiaries. Termination by consent of Grantor and a majority of the then living Beneficiaries shall be effective on the later to occur of (i) Grantor’s Board of Directors resolution and (ii) receipt by the Beneficiaries’ Representative of written consents from a majority of the then living Beneficiaries. 
6.1.2	Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative (jointly or separately) as applicable shall provide the Trustee and the Beneficiaries and their successors in interest with written notice of expiration at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date. 
6.1.3	In the event of a proposed termination prior to the expiration of the term of this Trust, Beneficiaries may assert a Demand if, in such Beneficiaries’ good faith judgment, there is a reasonable likelihood that following such proposed termination, a Claim will be asserted arising out of a Covered Act that occurred before the effective date of such termination. If so made, such Demand(s) shall be treated as a then existing and still pending Demand hereunder.
6.2	Distribution Upon Termination. When this Trust expires or is terminated in accordance with Section 6.1, the Trustee shall distribute the Trust Fund to Grantor less any full and adequate provision or reserves for any distributions to be made pursuant to any outstanding Demands under Sections 4.7 and 6.1.3 and any deductions authorized or required by Section 7.3. 
6.3	Amendment of Trust Instrument. 
6.3.1	Except in the event of a Change of Control, this Trust may be amended by consent of a majority of the then current Board of Directors and the Trustee, provided, however, no such amendment shall be effective (a) following a Change of Control, or (b) so as to reduce indemnification or advancement of expenses otherwise available to a Beneficiary of this Trust for any Claim then existing and still pending or with respect to any later asserted Claim arising out of a Covered Act occurring before the effective date of such amendment and provided further, that approval of the Trustee shall only be required if the proposed amendment affects in any way the Trustee’s rights or duties under this Agreement. If the Trust is amended without the consent of the Trustee as permitted above, Grantor shall deliver notice of amendment to the Trustee or its successor in interest thirty (30) days prior to the proposed effective date of the amendment by an instrument in writing executed by Grantor and the Beneficiaries’ Representative, together with a certified copy of the resolution of Grantor’s Board of Directors authorizing such amendment. Grantor shall send a copy of such notice to each individual Beneficiary or his or her successors in interest. 
6.3.2	In the event of a proposed amendment of this Trust, a Beneficiary may assert a Demand if, in the Beneficiary’s good faith judgment, there is a reasonable likelihood that following such proposed amendment, a Claim will be asserted arising out of a Covered Act that occurred before the effective date of such amendment and that will be affected by such amendment. 
If so made, such Demand(s) shall be treated as a then existing and still pending Demand hereunder.
ARTICLE 7 
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE TRUSTEE 
7.1	Duties of Trustee. The duties and liabilities of the Trustee shall at all times be limited to those expressly stated in this Agreement and no implied duties or covenants shall be read into this Agreement against the Trustee. The Trustee shall discharge its duties hereunder with the reasonable care of a professional bank custodian for hire providing similar services to those set forth in this Agreement. 
7.2	Indemnification of Trustee. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized hereby or within the rights or powers conferred upon it hereunder, or taken or omitted by it in accordance with advice of counsel (which counsel may be of the Trustee’s own choosing and which may be house counsel of the Trustee), and shall not be liable for any mistake of fact or error of judgment or for any acts or omissions of any kind unless caused by willful misconduct or gross negligence. Grantor agrees to indemnify the Trustee and its officers, directors, agents and employees and hold it and them harmless against any and all liabilities, losses, claims, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) and damages incurred by it hereunder, except for liabilities, losses, claims, expenses, and damages incurred by the Trustee resulting from its own willful misconduct or gross negligence.

Within ninety (90) days after the close of each fiscal year, or any termination of the duties of the Trustee, the Trustee shall prepare, sign and submit in duplicate to Grantor an account of its acts and transactions as Trustee under this Trust. 
7.5	Rights of Trustee. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise to incur any liability, financial or otherwise, in the performance of any of its duties hereunder. The Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees appointed with due care, and shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent, attorney, custodian or nominee so appointed, provided, however, the Trustee shall be responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Trustee be liable for special, indirect, punitive or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. The Trustee shall not be liable for an error in judgment made in good faith by an officer or officers of the Trustee, unless the Trustee was grossly negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts. 
Whenever in the administration of the provisions of this Agreement the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering any action to be taken hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by the Beneficiaries’ Representative and an officer of Grantor and delivered to the Trustee, and such certificate, in the absence of gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Agreement upon the faith thereof. The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, entitlement order, approval or other paper or document.
7.6	Right to Vote Assets. (a) Whenever Eligible Securities in the Trust Account (including, but not limited to, warrants, options, conversions, subscriptions, takeovers, other forms of capital reorganizations, redemptions, tenders, options to tender or non mandatory puts or calls) confer optional rights on the Grantor or provide for discretionary action or alternative courses of action by the Grantor, the Grantor shall be responsible for making any decisions relating thereto and for instructing the Trustee to act. The Trustee shall notify the Grantor of rights or discretionary actions with respect to Eligible Securities as promptly as practicable under the circumstances, provided that the Trustee has actually received notice of such right or discretionary corporate action from the relevant depository, etc. Absent actual receipt of such notice, the Trustee shall have no liability for failing to so notify the Grantor. Absent the Trustee’s timely receipt of instructions, the Trustee shall not be liable for failure to take any action relating to or to exercise any rights conferred by such Eligible Securities. In order for the Trustee to act subject to this subsection, it must receive the Grantor’s Instructions (defined below) at the Trustee’s offices, by the deadline specified by the Trustee, in its sole discretion, from time to time. If the Trustee does not receive such written instructions prior to its specified deadlines, the Trustee shall not be liable for failure to take any action relating to or to exercise any rights conferred by such Eligible Securities. 
(b)	In order to facilitate access by Grantor or its designee to ballots or online systems to assist in the voting of proxies received for eligible positions of securities held in the Trust Fund (excluding bankruptcy matters), the Trustee will, at the written request of Grantor upon the execution of this Agreement, appoint a provider of proxy voting services to act as agent of Grantor to provide global proxy voting services to Grantor. Trustee shall have no obligation or liability in respect of such proxy voting services or the acts or omissions of the provider of such proxy voting services.
7.7	Electronic Means.  The Trustee shall have the right to accept and act upon instructions, including funds transfer instructions (“Instructions”) given pursuant to this Agreement and delivered using Electronic Means; provided, however, that the Grantor shall provide to the Trustee an incumbency certificate listing officers with the authority to provide such Instructions (“Authorized Officers”) and containing specimen signatures of such Authorized Officers, which incumbency certificate shall be amended by the Grantor whenever a person is to be added or deleted from the listing. If the Grantor or Beneficiaries’ Representative elects to give the Trustee Instructions using Electronic Means and the Trustee in its discretion elects to act upon such Instructions, the Trustee’s understanding of such Instructions shall be deemed controlling. The Grantor understands and agrees that the Trustee cannot determine the identity of the actual sender of such Instructions and that the Trustee shall conclusively presume that directions that purport to have been sent by an Authorized Officer listed on the incumbency certificate provided to the Trustee have been sent by such Authorized Officer. The Grantor shall be responsible for ensuring that only Authorized Officers transmit such Instructions to the Trustee and that the Grantor and all Authorized Officers are solely responsible to safeguard the use and confidentiality of applicable user and authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys upon receipt by the Grantor. The Trustee shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from the Trustee’s reliance upon and compliance with such Instructions notwithstanding such directions conflict or are inconsistent with a subsequent written instruction. The Grantor agrees: (i) to assume all risks arising out of the use of Electronic Means to submit Instructions to the Trustee, including without limitation the risk of the Trustee acting on unauthorized Instructions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties; (ii) that it is fully informed of the protections and risks associated with the various methods of transmitting Instructions to the Trustee and that there may be more secure methods of transmitting Instructions than the method(s) selected by the Grantor; (iii) that the security procedures (if any) to be followed in connection with its transmission of Instructions provide to it a commercially reasonable degree of protection in light of its particular needs and circumstances; and (iv) to notify the Trustee immediately upon learning of any compromise or unauthorized use of the security procedures. The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” “delivery,” and words of like import in or relating to this Agreement or any document to be signed in connection with this Agreement shall be deemed to include electronic signatures, deliveries or the keeping of records in electronic form (including any electronic signature complying with the New York Electronic Signatures and Records Act (N.Y. State Tech. §§ 301-309), as amended from time to time, or other applicable law) or by other transmission method, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, and the parties hereto consent to conduct the transactions contemplated hereunder by Electronic Means. 
7.8	OFAC Certification and Covenants.
(a) 	Throughout the term of this Agreement, the Grantor (i) will have in place and will implement commercially reasonable policies and procedures designed to prevent violations of Sanctions, including measures to accomplish effective and timely scanning of all relevant data with respect to its clients and with respect to incoming or outgoing assets or transactions relating to this Agreement; (ii) shall ensure that neither the Grantor, any of the Grantor’s affiliates, directors, officers, employees, nor any Beneficiary is an individual or entity that is, or is owned or controlled by an individual or entity that is: (A) the target of Sanctions; or (B) located, organized or resident in a country or territory that is, or whose government is, the target of Sanctions; and (iii) shall not, directly or indirectly, use the services and/or Accounts in any manner that would result in a violation by any party of Sanctions. 
(b) 	The Grantor will promptly provide to the Trustee such information as the Trustee reasonably requests in connection with the matters referenced in this Section 7.8, including information regarding the Beneficiaries, the Trust Fund, the assets in relation to which services are to be provided and the source thereof, and the identity of any individual or entity having or claiming an interest therein. The Trustee may decline to act or provide services, and take such other actions as it, in its reasonable discretion, deems necessary or advisable, in connection with the matters referenced in this Section 7.8. If the Trustee declines to act or provide services as provided in the preceding sentence, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law or official request, the Trustee will inform the Grantor as soon as reasonably practicable.
ARTICLE 8 
MISCELLANEOUS 
8.1	Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial. 
(a)	The validity, interpretation, performance, and enforcement of this Agreement and the Trust created hereby shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, provided, however, that the rights, duties, obligations and protections of the Trustee hereunder shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York. The parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction and venue of any Washington State or United States Federal Court sitting in Seattle, Washington. Any proceeding with respect to this Trust shall be in King County Superior Court unless otherwise consented to by Grantor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any action regarding the rights, duties, obligation and protections of the Trustee hereunder each party consents to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court situated in New York City, New York in connection with any dispute arising hereunder and each party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
(b)	Each party hereto hereby agrees not to elect a trial by jury of any issue triable of right by jury, and waives any right to trial by jury fully to the extent that any such right shall now or hereafter exist with regard to this Agreement, or any claim, counterclaim or other action arising in connection herewith. This waiver of right to trial by jury is given knowingly and voluntarily by each party, and is intended to encompass individually each instance and each issue as to which the right to a trial by jury would otherwise accrue. 
8.2	Assignment; Successors. Neither this Agreement nor any rights or benefits hereunder may be assigned (including by operation of law), transferred, pledged or otherwise hypothecated without the prior written consent of the other parties, provided, however, in the event of a sale, dissolution or merger of the Trustee, only such consents to such event as set forth in Section 5.3.1 hereof shall be required. This Agreement and the Trust created hereby shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the spouses, heirs, and personal and legal representatives, estates of the Beneficiaries, and to the permitted assigns of the parties to this Trust. 
8.3	Third Party Beneficiaries. The Beneficiaries are specifically acknowledged as third party beneficiaries of this Agreement and shall have the right to bring actions to enforce this Agreement where the Beneficiaries’ Representative fails to bring such an action or fails to prosecute an action in good faith following a demand by a Beneficiary to so act. 
8.4	Enforcement Expenses. Grantor shall be responsible for all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, incurred in any action brought to enforce or interpret this Agreement, whether brought by the Beneficiaries’ Representative, a Beneficiary, the Trustee, or otherwise, unless the court determines that such Claim for enforcement was not brought in good faith or was frivolous. 
8.5	Titles and Headings Not to Control. The titles to articles and headings of sections in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and in case of any conflict the text of this Agreement, rather than any title or heading, shall control. 
8.6 	Notices, Consents and Other Communications. All notices, consents, or other communications required or contemplated by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered by (a) personal delivery, (b) prepaid overnight courier, (c) postage prepaid return receipt requested certified mail, or (d) email:
Notice by personal delivery shall be effective upon the date delivery is made and notice by certified mail or overnight courier shall be effective on the date it is recorded as delivered by the U.S. Postal Service or the overnight courier, respectively. Email notice shall be effective on the date sent to a valid address so long as no notice of failure of delivery is received by sender. Each Beneficiary and the Beneficiaries’ Representative shall provide Trustee and Grantor with prompt notice of changes of address. 
8.7	Force Majeure. The Trustee shall not be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement to the extent caused, directly or indirectly, by natural disasters, fire, acts of God, strikes or other labor disputes, work stoppages, acts of war or terrorism, general civil unrest, actual or threatened epidemics, disease, act of any government, governmental authority or police or military authority, declared or threatened state of emergency, legal constraint, the interruption, loss or malfunction of utilities or transportation, communications or computer systems, or any other similar events beyond its reasonable control. The Trustee will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the effect of any such events. 
8.8 	Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, and shall be deemed an original and shall bind the signatory but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the others, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.
